Cheshire East Local Plan

Local Plan Strategy
2010 - 2030
Adopted 27 July 2017

Foreword
The Local Plan is the council's most important tool for shaping development in Cheshire East over
the period to 2030. This Local Plan Strategy is the first part of this new Local Plan and supports the
council's priority of jobs-led growth. The plan has been developed to support the generation of jobs
focused around Crewe High Growth City, the M6 Corridor and the North Cheshire Science Corridor.
In addition, there is provision for extended employment sites in our main towns.
This plan is about developing Cheshire East to maintain its reputation as the best place to live in the
north west, whilst providing for our younger generation so they can live and work in the area they
grew up in. It is about the future, job availability, excellent educational standards and a great quality
of life. This plan, coupled with the five year housing land supply, is also about protecting the residents
of Cheshire East against unwanted, unsustainable and unplanned development.
The Inspector acknowledged that this is one of the most complex and consulted-upon planning
documents he had seen in his more than 20 years' experience. There has been a tremendous response
from our residents and other stakeholders during the extensive 13 rounds of public consultation on
the proposals in the plan and I'm sure it has allowed everyone to feel they had the opportunity to
have their say. The council received a total of more than 60,000 comments during the various
consultations to arrive at the finalised Local Plan Strategy. This represents an unprecedented level
of interest in a council consultation process.
Over the course of plan preparation, we have evaluated hundreds of strategic sites to ensure
sustainability. This has included their accessibility to public services, open spaces and transport, as
well as their potential impact on heritage and health. Contained in this document is the final list of 50
strategic sites, three strategic locations and eight safeguarded sites. In arriving at these sites, we
have considered comments from a large number of stakeholders including the residents of Cheshire
East, town and parish councils, the development industry and, of course, the planning inspector.
I would like to thank everybody who has contributed to this process and would especially like to thank
the large number of people who responded to the consultations and who participated in the examination
process; the plan is certainly a better one as a result of these contributions. Some people will be
pleased with the result and others will be less satisfied; however this plan has taken all views into
consideration and I firmly believe it meets the requirements of Cheshire East's residents both now,
and over the period to 2030.
Following on from the Local Plan Strategy, our next task is to prepare
the 'Site Allocations and Development Policies Document' and the
'Minerals and Waste Development Plan Document'. These will form
the second and third parts of our new Local Plan. They will allocate
non-strategic sites to meet the remaining development requirements,
provide further detailed policies to assist in determining planning
applications, and set out our approach to minerals and waste
planning in Cheshire East.
Thank you once again for your interest and continued involvement.

Overview
1.1 The Local Plan is the Statutory Development Plan for Cheshire East and is the basis for
determining planning applications. This Local Plan Strategy document sets out the overall vision and
planning strategy for development in the borough and contains planning policies to ensure that new
development addresses the economic, environmental and social needs of the area. It also identifies
strategic sites and strategic locations that will accommodate most of the new development needed.
1.2 The borough is a generally affluent area, especially in the north and is a sought-after place to
live and do business. There are however some pockets of deprivation, particularly in Crewe.
1.3 The previous overall approach to accommodating development, as set out in the Regional
Spatial Strategy, was one of development restraint reflective of the extensive coverage of Green Belt
in the borough and the intention to foster urban regeneration in Greater Manchester and Merseyside
in particular.
1.4 Like the country as a whole the borough was hit by the recent recession; house building rates
in Cheshire East fell in the late noughties to less than half of those achieved earlier in the decade.
1.5 However Cheshire East remains well placed in terms of its inherent locational, environmental
and labour force resources, to achieve significant economic growth in the medium to long term.
1.6

Due to its various attractions the borough is a net importer of people from neighbouring areas.

1.7 The Local Plan seeks to meet the full objectively assessed needs for development. This includes
accommodating a realistic element of economic growth-derived development need.
1.8 Although there are some inevitable overlaps with urbanised neighbouring places, particularly
south Manchester and the Potteries, Cheshire East’s housing market areas are largely contained
within the borough.
1.9 The borough’s housing needs arise across the whole plan area. Those towns inset within the
Green Belt have been constrained from growing for many years which has inevitably impacted on
local retail and other services.
1.10 However, good and justifiable reasons are needed to change the extent of the Green Belt.
The pre-requisite question that needs to be asked is could places neighbouring Cheshire East
accommodate any of the development needs arising in the borough and so reduce the need to roll
back Green Belt boundaries?
1.11 The answer from neighbouring local authorities is that they are not in a position to assist, and
they have not asked Cheshire East Council to accommodate any of their development requirements
either.

1.13 There are no significant flood risks in the borough that are an impediment to new development
nor are there any other naturally occurring environmental features within Cheshire East or nearby
that present such constraints. The effective operation of the Jodrell Bank radio telescope does not
pose a significant restriction on new development.
1.14 The Local Plan seeks to accommodate a proportion of the local development pressures at
the Green Belt-constrained towns by rolling back Green Belt boundaries around these settlements.
Enabling development in this way also contributes to the overall sustainability of these places.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Introduction

1.12 There are no other significant restraints that can legitimately be cited to justify holding back
development in Cheshire East. The north eastern extremity of the borough is within the Peak District
National Park but that area is excluded from the Local Plan area as the borough council is not the
local planning authority there.

3

1.15 However, overall there is some redistribution of the growth arising in the Green Belt towns to
settlements elsewhere in the borough – particularly to those in the centre and south.
1.16 A revised Strategic Green Gap policy is proposed in the vicinity of Crewe and Nantwich to
ensure settlements here do not coalesce whilst still leaving appropriate scope for further development
in the plan period and beyond. The exact boundaries of this revised Strategic Green Gap will be
determined through the Local Plan Site Allocations and Development Policies Document.
1.17 Following the previous constraints to development in the borough it is inevitable that there will
be some delay in achieving economic growth and gearing up the delivery of new development.
1.18 The plan proposes housing and employment development in a variety of locations and sizes
of site that provide an appropriate range and choice of opportunities. Some of these development
locations are required to be serviced by significant new infrastructure.
1.19 The delivery of development sites is programmed to reflect their infrastructure requirements
and the likely availability of associated funding.
1.20 The financial viability of the range of development sites is generally good across the borough
and the council is committed to maximising developer contributions to infrastructure delivery by
introducing the Community Infrastructure Levy.

Background
1.21 Its vibrant and successful economy, rich natural environment and strong sense of community,
makes Cheshire East one of the best places to live and work in the UK.
1.22 The borough has a strong industrial heritage: the railway industry in Crewe, the silk industry
in Macclesfield and Congleton, and the salt industry of Middlewich and Nantwich. Not only has that
resulted in the distinctive physical and cultural landscapes that are seen today, but it has also set the
foundations for the strong entrepreneurial culture which continues to permeate through the area.
1.23 In conjunction with historic industrial centres, vibrant and historic market towns located
throughout the borough, with their attractive and varied townscapes and concentrations of listed
buildings, provide high quality living and working environments, and are a key part of the borough’s
visitor economy. Many are also designated as conservation areas. Their rich historic environment
provides the focus for vibrant and locally distinct communities, with a strong sense of place and self.
They also provide a valuable link to rural communities, which are equally vital to the wider economy
and local identity. Their conservation and enhancement is extremely important, to ensure that
communities remain genuinely sustainable, retain their individual character and maintain their important
economic function.
1.24 The richness and diversity of the built and cultural heritage, and highly attractive townscapes
and landscapes provides Cheshire East with its own very unique character and identity.
1.25

The objective for the future of Cheshire East is to deliver:

Introduction

Sustainable, Jobs-led Growth and Sustainable, Vibrant Communities.

4

1.26 This Local Plan Strategy is the spatial interpretation of that vision and sets out how the economy
can continue to thrive by providing new land for development, whilst minimising the impact on the
natural environment.
1.27 The overall growth proposition is to deliver at least 36,000 new homes and around 31,000
additional jobs by 2030. These figures represent a pro-growth policy position that is forecast to see
the borough's population grow by around 58,100 people. Policies in this plan will also make sure that

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

the right mix of new homes is provided to meet the needs of a growing workforce and support both
current and future employers. This is set within the demographic context that Cheshire East will have
a 65% increase in the population aged 65 and above, and a 134% increase in the population aged
85 and above over the plan period.
1.28 The Local Plan Strategy has been built up over many years of evidence gathering and following
extensive consultation with residents. It aims to make the most effective use of land and development
across the borough to deliver the overall vision. The plan has been guided by the extensive body of
evidence detailed in Appendix D and the findings of Sustainability Appraisals and Habitats Regulations
Assessments carried out at each key stage of the plan's evolution.
1.29

The policy principles underpinning the vision are to:
Develop brownfield sites, where possible, to minimise the use of greenfield, Strategic Green
Gap, open countryside or Green Belt sites.
Ensure a town-centre first policy to support our main urban centres and deter out of town
development.
Deliver new homes of the right quality, in the right location at the right price; providing access
to low cost and affordable housing to support our growing economy.
Support new development with the right new infrastructure; our plan proposes at least eight
miles of new roads and substantial upgrades to our overall transport network.
Focus new housing development in strategic locations through the creation of a new sustainable
urban village and urban extensions, rather than a dispersed growth model that would undermine
the well defined character and strengths of our market towns and smaller villages.

1.30
plan.

There are 50 strategic sites, 3 strategic locations and 8 safeguarded sites proposed in this

1.31 All potential sites have been fully considered against policy principles and vision, the extensive
evidence base in its entirety, national planning policy and the findings from the Sustainability Appraisal
and Habitats Regulations Assessments as well as information received from the many consultation
events. This is a complex process but the selection of sites and strategic locations proposed in this
plan are considered to be the most appropriate when considered against the reasonable alternatives
and will facilitate the delivery of the overall vision and strategic priorities set out in the plan.
1.32 The council has carefully considered and taken account of, where appropriate, the wide range
of comments received at each stage. Further detail on the preparation of the Local Plan is contained
within Appendix F: 'The Local Plan for Cheshire East' and Appendix G: 'Evolution of the Local Plan
Strategy'.

1.34 Extensive dialogue and engagement from all neighbours has taken place over the course of
the evolution and development of the plan, thereby ensuring delivery on the Duty to Co-operate.
Wide-ranging partnerships with the Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) and
partners in Staffordshire and Greater Manchester are key to continued success and this plan both
complements those of our LEP neighbours in Greater Manchester and Staffordshire, and delivers
fully towards the Cheshire and Warrington LEP ambitions.
1.35 This plan sets out a core ambition, the overall strategic approach to accommodating growth
including the identification of strategic sites and locations for development. It also sets out policy
principles to be worked up in more detail at the next stage of the plan-making process. More detailed
policies will flow as part of the next stage of the Local Plan through the development of the Site

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Introduction

1.33 Cheshire East is part of the Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP),
which is made up of business, local authority, academia and voluntary sector representatives. The
vision of the Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership is to make Cheshire and Warrington
the best performing economy outside of the South East and the Local Plan Strategy seeks to contribute
towards achieving that vision. The Local Enterprise Partnership can access funding from central
government to deliver its objectives and overall vision.

Allocations and Development Policies Document and the Minerals and Waste Development Plan
Document.
1.36 This plan is strongly underpinned by a need to improve transport connections across the
borough. New projects are planned in all towns as part of the plan, to address congestion issues.
These include the Congleton Link Road, South Macclesfield Link Road, and improvements on the
A51, A530 and A500 Barthomley Link.
1.37 The focus remains on protecting Green Belt, open spaces and the best agricultural land to
make sure that growth is sustainable. However, some alterations to the detailed Green Belt boundary
have been required to provide the development land needed to deliver the vision.
1.38 The identification of safeguarded land between the urban area and the inner boundary of the
Green Belt means that the permanence of the new Green Belt boundary will be secured. The
safeguarded land is not proposed for development in this plan but may be required post 2030 if a
future review of the plan identifies further needs for development.
1.39 In total, the plan makes detailed boundary amendments to the Green Belt that exclude an
area of around 1.5% of the total previous area of Green Belt in the borough.
1.40

A new settlement is also proposed to mitigate some of the impact on existing Green Belt.

1.41 Protecting the quality of the environment is essential to the plan. The plan needs to make
sure there are the right levels of Green Belt to protect from urban sprawl, and provide sufficient levels
of fertile agricultural land to support the rural economy. The plan also needs to nurture the local
ecology and protect the natural countryside and landscape enjoyed by residents and visitors alike.
1.42 The borough's heritage and cultural assets are key to the future as well as a trail to the past.
They provide a vital contribution to the overall visitor economy, which has a turnover of £700m per
year. They are also treasured by residents, and provide a valuable overall contribution to quality of
life in the borough. Key considerations incorporated in this plan include continued protection of over
76 conservation areas, 47 grade 1, 179 grade 2* and 2,412 grade 2 listed buildings, and supportive
policies in relation to the cutting edge science research and worldwide heritage associated with Jodrell
Bank.
1.43 This plan will provide for at least 36,000 new homes by 2030. This does not mean house
building to meet a false target, but a considered approach to meeting the needs of future demographic
changes and to make sure that current and future employers have a skilled, local workforce who can
support their growth.

Introduction

1.44 New homes are required to respond, not only to population increases and economic migration,
but also to reflect the changing nature of the way in which our communities are living. People are
living longer and whilst overall this is clearly desirable, it does mean we need to rise to the challenge
of ensuring there is the right mix of accommodation, including Self Build and Key Worker Housing,
to meet the needs of a changing population; particularly to make sure that as many people as possible
remain independent for as long as possible. This is a core element of our vision for a vibrant,
sustainable community, but it does also mean we need to provide the right amount of future
accommodation of the right type, in the right location. At the next stage of the Local Plan process
through the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document, there will be much more detailed
policies about the quality, type, size and tenure mix of our proposed housing strategy.

6

1.45 Cheshire East currently benefits from excellent quality health and education provision, however
this plan will also make sure that our education and health provision is enhanced and developed to
meet the growing and changing needs of our communities.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Only by ensuring through this Local Plan Strategy that all these elements are balanced
and harmonised will we secure a healthy and prosperous future for the borough.

The Context of the Local Plan Strategy
1.46 Cheshire East is a unitary authority with borough status; created as part of local government
reorganisation in 2009 it covers the eastern part of the historic county of Cheshire. As a unitary
authority, the council is responsible for all local government functions including education, housing,
planning, highways, leisure and recreation, environmental health, adult and social services and
through its Health and Wellbeing Board, responsibilities for health in partnership with the NHS and
other agencies (police, fire and the voluntary sector).
1.47 The borough of Cheshire East is bounded by Cheshire West and Chester to the west;
Warrington and the Greater Manchester conurbation to the north; Shropshire and the North
Staffordshire conurbation of Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under-Lyme to the south; and the Peak
District National Park to the east.
1.48 Cheshire East is a large borough, with many towns, villages and rural areas with over 100
town and parish councils. The towns and villages vary greatly in character and each face differing
issues and needs for the future. The borough also has an extensive rural area with a successful rural
and agricultural based economy. Cheshire East as an entity currently has an emerging sense of place
and identity that this Local Plan Strategy aims to address.
1.49 The Local Plan, when it is fully adopted, will be the complete Development Plan for Cheshire
East (replacing earlier plans prepared by the former districts and the county council) and its policies
will form the basis for planning decisions in the borough. The Local Plan will cover a range of matters
including:
How much employment land is needed and where it should be provided;
Protecting and improving important open areas and providing new ones;
How many new homes will be required and where they should be located;
Providing new transport infrastructure including roads, cycle routes and footpaths; and
How town centres and community facilities in the borough could be improved.
1.50 The Local Plan Strategy is the first part of the Cheshire East Local Plan. It sets out the strategic
priorities for the future development of the area together with a suite of planning policies and proposals
designed to deliver sustainable development.
1.51 The Local Plan Strategy sets out how the council will deliver sustainable, jobs led growth by
making the most effective use of land and development across the borough. The economy in Cheshire
East is already one of the most successful in the North of England. The Local Plan Strategy will make
sure the right foundations are in place to sustain this success over the plan period.

Introduction

1.52 The Local Plan Strategy covers all of the borough of Cheshire East with the exception of the
area in the Peak District National Park. Figure 1.2 shows the borough in context.

1.56 In Chapter 15 there are Ordnance Survey based maps of each town showing the development
related proposals, as well as commitments (strategic developments that already have permission)
and larger scale maps of each site and strategic location. These maps are presented for illustrative
purposes.

1.57 The definitive spatial application of the proposals that are land allocations and the consequential
policy boundary changes are to be shown on the new Policies Map. This will be an update of the
combined Proposals Maps produced as part of the previous Local Plans adopted by the former district
and county councils.

2 Spatial Portrait
2.1 The Spatial Portrait sets out what Cheshire East and the surrounding area is like in 2014. It
looks at 'Cheshire East's Key Characteristics' before painting a picture of each of its 'Principal Towns',
'Key Service Centres' and 'Local Service Centres' followed by a brief overview of the 'Other
Settlements and Rural Areas'. Finally, the Spatial Portrait looks at the characteristics of and linkages
with the 'Surrounding Areas'.

Cheshire East's Key Characteristics
2.2 The key 'Economic', 'Social', 'Environmental' and 'Connectivity' characteristics of the borough
are set out in the sections below.

Economic
2.3 The economy of Cheshire East is diverse and generally vibrant. The Borough provides 7% of
(1)
the economic output in the North West and 7.6% of the region’s businesses - the highest share of
(2)
any North West Unitary or District authority . Its residents make up a significant proportion of the
'knowledge economy' workforce that drives the region: around 68,000 of its residents work in
managerial or professional occupations - which is higher than in any other North West unitary or
(3)
district authority apart from Manchester . Cheshire East performs better than the regional and UK
(4)
(5)
(6)
averages in skill levels , business start ups and knowledge-based employment .
2.4 The number of people employed in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry and in Research
and Development (R&D) is significantly above the Great Britain average with particular concentrations
(7)
in the former Macclesfield district, for example AstraZeneca . There is a relative abundance of jobs
(significant net inflows of commuters, in other words) in Crewe, Handforth and Knutsford, whereas
Alsager, Congleton, Middlewich, Poynton and Sandbach face a relative shortage of jobs (a significant
net commuting outflow). Macclesfield and Nantwich have more modest net outflows, whilst Wilmslow’s
(8)
inflows and outflows are broadly equal . The rural nature of the borough is reflected in the relatively
(9)
high number of people employed in agriculture which is above the England average .

Labour Force
2.5 The 2013 Strategic Housing Market Assessment data shows that over two-thirds (69%) of
Cheshire East's economically active residents' place of work is in the borough.
2.6 An estimated 173,500 people were working in Cheshire East in 2012, as either employees or
working proprietors. Of those working as employees (167,000), 69% were full-time and 31% part-time.
13% of employees worked in the health and social work sector, with professional, scientific and

Income Levels
2.7 The latest available average (mean) household income figure (2010) for Cheshire East is
(11)
£39,900 per year, however there are significant differences in income levels across the borough .
Seven towns and major settlements have a mean income below the Cheshire East average; of these,
five (Alsager, Congleton, Crewe, Nantwich and Sandbach) are in the south of the borough; only
Handforth and Macclesfield are in the north. Conversely, high mean incomes are more prevalent in
the north of the borough; Knutsford, Poynton and Wilmslow are all above the Cheshire East average
(as is Middlewich further south). Mean incomes are also above the borough average in Cheshire
East’s rural areas. This is shown in Figure 2.1 below.

Figure 2.1 Mean Average Yearly Household Income in Cheshire East (£)

Skills
2.8 The borough has major educational assets, in terms of skills development and knowledge
transfer, in the form of Manchester Metropolitan University at Crewe and three Further Education
colleges: South Cheshire, Reaseheath and Macclesfield. Jodrell Bank is of great scientific significance
as a leading facility for radio-astrophysics and scientific research in the UK.

2.9 The closeness of Manchester Airport provides considerable economic benefits to the borough
by providing access to national and international markets as well as supporting a substantial number
of jobs, both directly and indirectly. In 2011, the Airport was estimated to contribute £627 million of
Gross Value Added for the North West Region, supporting over 17,000 onsite jobs and 40,000 in the
(12)
wider sub-region .

Waste Management

Spatial Portrait

2.11 Evidence shows that about 870,000 tonnes of waste were generated in Cheshire East in 2009.
(13)
. The principal types of waste arising in
This is predicted to fall to about 797,000 tonnes by 2030
Cheshire East are municipal (including household), commercial and industrial (C&I), construction,
demolition and excavation (CD&E) and hazardous. The way in which waste is managed has been
changing significantly with decreasing amounts being disposed of to landfill and increasing amounts
being recycled.

Retailing
2.12 Cheshire East has a diverse retail offer, ranging from a mix of central and out-of-town multiple
retailers in our larger towns, to stronger niche independent retailing in some of our smaller towns.
In common with most of the country, some of our town centres have struggled in the face of changing
consumer trends, particularly the growth in retailing via the internet and competitor destinations
offering a larger mix of retail and leisure. However, there is evidence that new investment can
recapture a larger share of local consumer expenditure and footfall, which is an approach being driven
forward through regeneration programmes led by the council with the support of our business
communities.

Visitor Economy

2.13 The visitor economy is an important contributor to the Cheshire East economy with about
(14)
10,000 jobs associated with the tourism industry and a turnover of £700 million . Major attractions
include Tatton Park, Jodrell Bank, Lyme Park, Quarry Bank Mill, the canal network and the Peak
District National Park. There are 14 National Trust properties in Cheshire East and one partially
located in the borough. Little Moreton Hall, Nether Alderley Mill, Tatton Park, Lyme Park and Quarry
Bank Mill are all examples of National Trust properties. Additionally, the extensive footpath, cycleway
and bridleway network is a key attraction of the borough.

2.14 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) 2010 and 2013 Update considered that,
on the basis of migration and travel to work data, Cheshire East is an appropriate geography for
planning purposes over which to assess and meet housing requirements and comprises of three
functional housing market areas: one focused on the former Macclesfield district exhibiting strong
interactions with the South Manchester market; a second focused on the former Crewe and Nantwich
district being largely self-contained; and a third centred around Congleton. The subsequent Housing
Development Study (2015) concludes that Cheshire East comprises two functional sub-market areas
suggested by the data: a southern part which is strongly linked to North Staffordshire and
Stoke-on-Trent, and a northern part which is closely linked with Greater Manchester. At the Borough
scale there are noticeable market interactions with North Staffordshire and South Manchester (see
Figure 2.5).

Population
2.15
Cheshire East has a population of
372,100, 51% (189,700) are female and 49%
(15)
(182,400) are male . This represents 0.66%
of the population of England and Wales. The
population pyramid in Figure 2.6 shows the
age distribution of Cheshire East residents. It
reveals a lower than average proportion of
both males and females for residents under
the age of 40 compared to England and
Wales. The proportions are particularly low
(greater than one percentage point below the
England and Wales average) for residents
aged 20 to 34. Conversely, Cheshire East
has an above average proportion of residents
within each of the five year age bands over
the age of 40. The relatively low proportion Figure 2.6 Population Pyramid for Cheshire East 2012 (Mid
of people of working age and relatively high
Year Estimates)
proportion of older people has implications for
the housing needs of the population and for the future economic prosperity of the borough.
2.16 Over the ten year period from July 2001 until June 2011, an estimated 157,000 people moved
into Cheshire East and 141,800 people moved out of the borough. These estimates include people
immigrating and emigrating and those moving within the UK. The result is a net in-flow of 15,200
people (an average of around 1,500 each year). Net migration was higher in the early part of this
ten year period: for example, the average net migration per year between July 2001 and June 2006
(16)
was around 1,900, compared to 1,200 between July 2006 and June 2011 .

2.17 Information from the 2011 Census of population shows that the average household size in
Cheshire East was around 2.29 people. Housing need is expected to increase as a result of national
trends, including predicted increases in the population and changes to household sizes resulting from
an increased number of divorces and separations, and an ageing population. The 2011 Interim
Household Projections show an increase in the number of households from 159,600 in 2011 to
170,000 in 2021. This equates to an average increase of around 1,050 households per year between
2011 and 2021.

House Prices
2.18 House prices across Cheshire East and its former Districts have increased dramatically over
the period 1996 to 2012 from median house prices of £59,833 in 1996 to £174,950 in the autumn of

2012, with median prices peaking at £185,843 during 2007
in median house prices over a 16 year period.

. This represents an increase of 192%
(18)

2.19 Cheshire East has a ratio of lower quartile house prices to lower quartile earnings of 6.51 .
This means that the price of a house at the top end of the cheapest quarter of all houses costs 6.51
times the earnings of a person who earns the most out of the lowest quarter of all earnings. In terms
(17)
of relative affordability, the borough is ranked the sixth least affordable district in the North West .

Deprivation
2.20 The Index of Multiple Deprivation data (IMD 2010) combines a number of economic, social
and environmental indicators to assess and identify levels of deprivation in a particular area. These
indicators are then combined to provide an overall score identifying the level of deprivation at a Lower
Super Output Area (LSOA) level.
2.21 Of the 231 LSOAs (pre-2011) in Cheshire East, 23 are amongst the 25% most deprived in
England. Fourteen of these are in Crewe, three are in Macclesfield and one is in each of Alsager,
Congleton, Handforth, Knutsford, Nantwich and Wilmslow. Five of these LSOAs, all in Crewe, are
amongst the 10% most deprived in England. Conversely, 121 of the 231 LSOAs in Cheshire East
are amongst the 25% least deprived in England, including 71 that are amongst the 10% least
(19)
deprived .

Environmental
Landscape Character
2.22 Cheshire East’s landscape is characterised by the contrast between the extensive flat lowland
plain and gently rolling farmland bordered to the west of the borough with the distinctive sandstone
ridge and to the east by the rising Pennine foothills. The landscape is characterised by glacial deposits,
river valleys with wooded cloughs, unimproved features including mosses, heaths, meres and a
number of designated parkland estates. There is also a diverse and valued range of flora and fauna
in the borough.

Historic Environment and Heritage
2.25 Cheshire East contains a valued, varied and unique heritage, which includes a number of
cultural and environmental assets. These assets include Macclesfield's industrial heritage, Crewe's
railway heritage, Tegg's Nose Country Park, Lindow Man at Lindow Moss, Bickerton and Peckforton
Hills, Beeston Castle, the canal network, historic towns and parts of the Peak District National Park,
amongst others. Other unique attractions include a wealth of Historic Parks and Gardens. The
borough also has a rich archaeological resource from the prehistoric period to the Second World
War, including sites such as the Bridestones Neolithic chambered tomb, the Roman and medieval
saltworking remains of Middlewich and Nantwich, the Saxon Sandbach Crosses and the defences
of the former airfield at RAF Cranage. The borough’s historic built environment is complex due, for
the most part, to the size and diversity of the area. Constituent areas are heavily influenced by their
geological, landscape and topographical character, which invariably has heavily influenced their
purpose, character and identity.
Formal cultural designations present in Cheshire East include:
76 conservation areas of varying size and scale;
2,638 listed buildings covering different gradings;
108 scheduled monuments;
17 registered parks and gardens of historic interest;
1 registered battlefield;
10 areas of archaeological potential and 6,708 sites of archaeological importance; and
387 locally listed buildings.

Green Belt
2.27 Cheshire East has around 400 square kilometres of land designated as Green Belt, located
in the northern and south eastern parts of the borough. These form part of the Green Belts surrounding
Greater Manchester and the Potteries conurbations.

Carbon Dioxide Emissions
2.28 Statistics indicate that, in 2011, Cheshire East’s residents, commerce and industry and other
non-residential energy uses resulted in carbon dioxide emissions of 3.159m tonnes. This equates to
8.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions per person, which is more than the regional average of 7.0 tonnes per
person. However, CO2 emissions per person have fallen in recent years from 10.6 tonnes in 2005
(20)
and 9.2 tonnes in 2010 . This has implications for local, regional and national air quality.

Connectivity

Spatial Portrait

2.29 The extensive road network in the borough includes the M6 Motorway, which runs north to
south through the centre of the borough and the M56 running east to west at the northern end of
Cheshire East. The M56 links to the M6 in the north of the borough.

18

2.30 The rail network is accessible from 22 railway stations across the borough. Crewe and
Macclesfield are on separate branches of the West Coast Main Line, giving access to Greater
Manchester and London Euston. Central government has announced plans for a High Speed 2 rail
route from London, through the borough and up to Manchester and beyond. The initial preferred route
from the Department for Transport follows the West Coast Main Line, via Crewe, before passing to
the west of Middlewich and through the High Legh area before splitting, with a line going north over

the M56 to Manchester Airport and a separate line towards Wigan. Cheshire East Council is supportive
of the economic impacts of High Speed Rail but wants to keep environmental impacts to a minimum.
2.31 Historic transport routes crisscross the borough in the form of canals, railways and historic
roadways, further enriching the built heritage of the borough and influencing aspects of the townscape
and development of towns and villages. A number of landmark structures are associated with the
canals and railways, not least the viaducts across the Dane Valley to the east of Holmes Chapel and
at Bollington. Many canal structures are listed, including bridges, locks and mileposts. The Trent and
Mersey and Macclesfield canals are both designated as extensive, linear conservation areas.
2.32 In addition, Manchester Airport lies immediately to the north of the borough, offering worldwide
services.

2.33 The Principal Towns of Crewe and Macclesfield are the largest settlements in the borough.
They provide a wide range of services and opportunities for employment, retail, education and leisure.
They serve large catchment areas with high levels of accessibility and public transport provision.
However, the two towns are very different in their history, character and urban form.

Principal Towns

Crewe
(21)

2.34 Crewe is the largest town in Cheshire East, with a population of 73,400 . It is a major
employment centre with a diversified base in education, manufacturing, services and distribution.
Major employers include Bentley Motors, Mornflake, Leighton Hospital and Manchester Metropolitan
University. Crewe is the primary shopping centre in the south of the borough, but the town centre is
in need of major investment. The town is also noted for the award winning Crewe Business Park,
regarded as the country's first 'green business park'.
2.35 Crewe evolved around the growth of the railways, with
the opening of the station in 1837 and the first works in 1840.
Soon the industry was employing thousands of people and new
housing was built alongside the expanding railway works. Within
the centre of the town, the Town and Indoor Market Halls,
churches and chapels and later, the Queens Park and Lyceum
Theatre were all developed as part of the emerging social
infrastructure of the burgeoning town.
2.36 Crewe is often referred to as the 'Gateway to the North
West'. It was established as a major railway hub in the late
1830s and it remains a significant railway interchange on the West Coast Main Line with over 1.1
(22)
million passengers changing trains per year . As a consequence of the existing railway infrastructure,
there are problems with railway lines forming significant barriers to connectivity within the town.
(23)

2.37 Crewe's unemployment rate is higher than the borough average . In addition, Crewe residents
(11)
have the lowest average (mean) income within Cheshire East . Several parts of Crewe are
(19)
particularly disadvantaged
and in parts of the town, male life expectancy is around 10 years less
(24)
than in some of the more affluent areas of Cheshire East; for females, the gap is nearly 15 years .

Macclesfield
(21)

2.38 Macclesfield is the second largest town in Cheshire East, with a population of 52,500 . It is
situated in the north eastern part of the borough on the River Bollin. It is close to the borders of
Greater Manchester to the north, and the Peak District to the east. Macclesfield is a unique town,
with a proud history as a centre for commerce and business. This is best evidenced through
Macclesfield’s role in the silk trade and the town continues to play a leading role on the international
stage through the science and pharmaceutical industries.
th

2.39 Macclesfield was established as a settlement in the 13 Century and later developed around
the silk and textiles industries. Situated on the River Bollin, the early mills were located alongside the
river, utilising the damp conditions and the power of the river for mill machinery. Present day industries
include pharmaceuticals, plastics, architectural and engineering services and advertising and market
(10)
research . One of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca, is located at the
Hurdsfield Industrial Estate in Macclesfield and also at nearby Alderley Park. In addition, many
(25)
residents work in Greater Manchester.

Spatial Portrait

2.40 Today, Macclesfield stands as a bustling town centre with a number of unique attractions,
including the Silk Museum and the heritage centre, cobbled streets lined with independent shops and
galleries, all on the doorstep of the rolling hills of the Peak District.

under 500 shops. The centre of Macclesfield, characterised
in part by its cobbled and meandering streets and narrow
lanes, is essentially a medieval street pattern, partly overlaid
by later phases of the town’s growth. Although the northern
part of Cheshire East is largely very prosperous, Macclesfield
suffers localised problems, with some areas of the town
(19)
experiencing multiple deprivation . Its unemployment rate
(23)
exceeds the borough average .
2.42
There are a high number of listed buildings and
structures concentrated in the centre of the town and also
many that are quite widely distributed. Much of the town centre is designated as a conservation area
and there are also several outlying conservation areas. A number of buildings are also locally listed.
This illustrates the historic importance and significance of the town and reflects the strong identity,
character and picturesque qualities of Macclesfield.
2.43 As a former mill town, Macclesfield’s character and aesthetic are also proving to be its greatest
burden; congestion, narrow roads and clear issues of connectivity between the rail station, town
centre and a number of strategic employment sites mean that opportunities for development are
limited.
2.44 The town is well served by bus routes. The railway station is on the West Coast Main Line
with direct regular services to Stoke-on-Trent, Birmingham, Manchester and London Euston.

Key Service Centres
2.45 Cheshire East is characterised by its many smaller towns, each with its own distinctive history,
character and form. These towns lie at the heart of the borough, and their vitality and growth is
essential for the prosperity of the borough as a whole. Such towns serve as Key Service Centres for
a wider locality and usually have a good range of facilities including shops, schools and cultural and
leisure facilities.
2.46 The Key Service Centres of Cheshire East are: Alsager, Congleton, Handforth, Knutsford,
Middlewich, Nantwich, Poynton, Sandbach and Wilmslow.

Alsager
(21)

2.48 Alsager town centre stretches along the main street and
has about 100 retail units. In addition, the town centre includes
the recently remodelled Milton Park, a large area of public open
space. Parts of the town are characterised by spacious
tree-lined streets with attractive villas and designated as
conservation areas.
(8)

2.49 The number of jobs available within the area is low , although the unemployment rate is
(23)
lower than the Cheshire East average . Income levels are generally below the Cheshire East
(11)
average . One of the major employers in the town, Twyford, has closed its manufacturing operation
(although its distribution operation remains open).

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Spatial Portrait

2.47 Alsager is a small town in the south east of the borough with a population of 11,800 . It lies
east of Crewe and is close to the Potteries conurbation to the south. It was a small farming village
th
until the 19 Century when, due to its rail connections and rural character, it became popular with
managers from the nearby Potteries. During the Second World War, a large armaments factory was
built outside the town at Radway Green and the town grew to house the influx of factory workers.
This site, now with a range of occupiers, remains the town's largest employment location.

21

2.50 The town is served by several bus routes that provide access to Crewe, Hanley, Kidsgrove,
Nantwich and Sandbach. The railway station, which is a short walk from the town centre, provides
links to Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent, Derby, Lichfield and on to Northampton, Milton Keynes and
London Euston. Junction 16 of the M6 motorway is a short distance away.

Congleton
(21)

2.51 Congleton is a large market town with a population of 26,700 . It
lies on the River Dane in the east of the borough. In its early days, it was
an important centre of textile production, especially lace and leather gloves.
Currently, the principal industries in Congleton include the manufacture of
airbags. There are a number of light engineering factories and sand
extraction occurs on the Cheshire Plain, although many of the town's
(25)
residents work in Manchester, Macclesfield and Stoke-on-Trent .
2.52 Congleton has a reasonably vibrant town centre with about 260 retail
units. Planning permission was granted in February 2012 for a retail
development in the town centre that will increase the town's attractiveness.
The development will take the form of an extension to the Bridestones Centre
through to Mill Street, providing a new home for the town's market.
2.53 The town is served by several bus routes and has its own railway station with direct services
between Stoke-on-Trent and Manchester. The M6 motorway is a short distance away.

Handforth
2.54 Handforth is a suburban area on the northern edge of Cheshire East with a population of
(21)
6,600 . In the 1950s, two overspill housing estates were built in the area to re-house people from
inner city Manchester.
2.55
The town has a small shopping centre containing about 70 retail units. The Handforth Dean
Retail Park to the east of Handforth contains a number of large format retailers.
2.56 Average (mean) household income levels are the third
(11)
lowest in Cheshire East (out of 25 settlement areas) . A large
proportion of jobs in Handforth are located at the Stanley Green
industrial estate and the Handforth Dean Retail Park. There is
(25)
a very high level of in-commuting, particularly from Stockport .
There is a smaller, but still substantial volume of out-commuting
(26)
(with the majority of residents working outside Handforth) .

Spatial Portrait

2.57 There is no direct road access between the settlement of Handforth and Handforth Dean.
Access to the Retail Park is only available from the A34 bypass. Once constructed, the A555
Manchester Airport Eastern Link Road will provide quick road access to the airport and M56 motorway,
about 4 km to the north-west. Handforth has its own railway station with two trains per hour serving
Crewe and Manchester. Regular buses serve Macclesfield, Manchester, Stockport and Wilmslow.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Knutsford
2.58 Knutsford is said to be named after King Canute, who by tradition
th
th
forded the nearby River Lily. The town later prospered in the 18 and 19
Centuries and has many historic buildings. Today, Knutsford has a distinctive
character and identity and contains a number of employment areas including
the Parkgate Trading Estate, Longridge Trading Estate, Booths Park,
(21)
Radbroke Hall and others. The town has a population of 13,300 . It lies
in the north east of the borough approximately 19km to the south west of
Manchester and 18km north west of Macclesfield. After the Second World
War, overspill housing estates were created in the town to accommodate
families from Manchester. The town has one localised pocket of deprivation
(19)
which ranks among England’s most deprived 25% .
2.59 Within the town centre, there are over 200 retail units, making it an
important shopping centre in the borough. There is a linear high street
aligned by historic buildings of various periods, but principally Georgian, many of which are listed
and within the conservation area. The town thrived due to its close relationship with nearby Tatton
Park, one of the key heritage assets in Cheshire East and the ancestral home of the Egerton family.
Knutsford contains many buildings of architectural and historic importance.
2.60 There are daytime bus services linking Knutsford with Altrincham, Macclesfield, Northwich
and Wilmslow. The railway station is centrally located and has one train per hour to Chester,
Manchester, Northwich and Stockport. There are significant levels of out-commuting to Manchester,
(25)
Trafford and Cheshire West & Chester .

Middlewich
(21)

2.61 Middlewich is a market town with a population of 13,700 . It dates back to prehistoric times
with salt extraction from the Iron Age and throughout Roman times to the present day with British
Salt employing around 125 people. The salt industry and the canals remain important culturally and
economically. The closeness to the M6 motorway has led to the creation of a large distribution and
business park at Midpoint 18.

2.63 Although a railway line passes through the town, it is
currently used solely for freight movements. There is no railway station or passenger rail service
within the town; during the development of the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document,
an area of land will be safeguarded to explore the potential delivery of a new train station. Bus services
provide access to Crewe, Holmes Chapel, Congleton, Northwich, Sandbach and Winsford. The M6
motorway is a short distance away, linked to the town by the A54. An Eastern Bypass for Middlewich
has been partially constructed in recent years. The construction of the final section linking to the
A533 Booth Lane to the south of the town will open up further land for employment development as
well as improving environmental conditions in the town centre. The timing of this project, which is
largely dependent upon private sector funding, is currently being programmed. There is also the
longer-term need for improvements to the A54, predominantly in Cheshire West and Chester’s area,
to improve the strategic link between the M6 and Winsford.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Spatial Portrait

2.62 The town centre has about 80 retail units and is centred
on Wheelock Street. In recent years tourism has become
increasingly important, with the annual Folk and Boat Festival
being a notable attraction. The Trent and Mersey Canal runs
through the town and is an important tourism and recreational
resource. The canal is a conservation area, with a number of
listed structures and the Murgatroyd Brine Works nearby, which
is both listed and a scheduled monument.

23

Nantwich
(21)

2.64 Nantwich is a historic market town with a population of 18,000 . It dates back to Roman
times, when it was a centre for the production of salt. Nantwich has a thriving town centre with about
250 mainly independent units. The town contains more than 100 listed buildings, and has the largest
concentration of historic buildings in the borough. It is also a popular destination for tourists and
visitors drawn from its large rural hinterland.
2.65
The centre of Nantwich is in essence a planned
Elizabethan town, largely rebuilt as a consequence of a fire in
1583; the re-build being partly financed by Elizabeth I. This has
resulted in a re-created original street pattern and a number of
th
fine timber framed buildings dating from the 16 Century
onwards. There are also a number of elegant Georgian and
Victorian buildings. The centre of Nantwich contains a number
of listed buildings and is designated as a conservation area.
The town was also prominent in the Civil War and besieged until
the Parliamentary victory in January 1644. The battlefield is
designated and lies to the north of the town.
2.66 Nantwich railway station lies on the Crewe to Cardiff line by way of Shrewsbury. Bus services
are relatively good with regular services to residential areas of the town and to Crewe.

Poynton
2.67 Poynton’s origins lie as a small mining village. However, the decline of mining and its
th
accessibility to Greater Manchester led to significant growth during the 20 Century. Much of the
mining infrastructure has therefore been lost as the town expanded, but remnants of the associated
(21)
landscape still exist. It has a population of 13,000
and lies in the north eastern corner of the
borough, 11km north of Macclesfield and 8km south of Stockport.
2.68 The shopping centre has about 120 retail units. A programme of
environmental improvements has recently been completed in the town
centre.
2.69 Two buses per hour serve the town, providing links to Bollington,
Stockport and Macclesfield. The railway station is on the western side
of the town and has one train per hour serving stations between
Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent.

Sandbach
(21)

Spatial Portrait

2.70 Sandbach is a market town with a population of 18,100 . Its origins date back to Saxon
times and it is widely famed for its weekly Thursday market and the ancient Saxon Crosses. It contains
a number of areas and features of historical and architectural value as well as encompassing several
significant areas of local environmental importance. The town grew around truck manufacturing
industries, but since their closure in 2002 there have been significant changes in its employment base
with considerable losses of manufacturing jobs.

24

2.71 At its heart are the characterful cobbled market square and Anglo Saxon crosses, which are
both listed and a scheduled monument, along with a number of other key listed buildings. The wider
town centre is also designated as a conservation area, with a number of other prominent buildings.
The town also has strong associations with Sir George Gilbert Scott.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

2.72 The town centre has about 190 retail units. Sandbach is now the headquarters of Cheshire
East Council, which is the town's largest employer.
2.73 There is a railway station on the edge of the town providing services to Crewe, Manchester
and Manchester Airport. There are also frequent bus services to Congleton, Crewe, Northwich and
Macclesfield. The town lies adjacent to junction 17 of the M6 motorway.

Wilmslow
(21)

2.74 Wilmslow, with a population of 23,900
lies in the north of the borough. The town is noted
for its high quality housing and shopping as well as the historic Quarry Bank Mill and Styal Estate,
making it a sought-after location. Wilmslow has developed beyond its historic core and has substantial
late Victorian and Edwardian suburbs.
2.75 The town centre has about 230 retail units and is also
served by the out-of-town Handforth Dean Retail Park. The
town has a strong office sector both within the town centre and
also on a number of large peripheral office parks. A large number
of residents work in Manchester, with other significant commuter
(25)
flows to Stockport, Trafford and Macclesfield town . The
nearby Manchester Airport is also a major employer.
2.76 The town has easy road access to the M60 and M56
motorways. Manchester Airport is 5km to the north. Access
will be improved when the western section of the Manchester Airport Eastern Link Road is completed.
Wilmslow has a local bus network serving destinations including Knutsford, Macclesfield, Manchester
Airport, Manchester and Stockport. The railway station is on the West Coast Main Line and is served
by local and long-distance services. Direct destinations served include London Euston and Manchester
Piccadilly.

Local Service Centres
2.77 Local Service Centres are small towns or large villages which provide a range of services and
facilities to meet the needs of local people, including those living in nearby settlements. They typically
have a range of shops, health and leisure facilities, and employment opportunities.

Other Settlements and Rural Areas
2.79 The remaining other settlements and rural areas contain fewer facilities, if any. As a result,
people living in these communities generally have to travel to larger centres for jobs, schools, health
care and other services.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Spatial Portrait

2.78 Local Service Centres in Cheshire East are Alderley Edge, Audlem, Bollington, Bunbury,
Chelford, Disley, Goostrey, Haslington, Holmes Chapel, Mobberley, Prestbury, Shavington and
Wrenbury.

Figure 2.10 Neighbouring Authorities

The Potteries
2.80 North Staffordshire is known as ‘The Potteries’ after the porcelain industry that made the area
world famous. The Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under-Lyme joint Core Strategy identifies that the
area faces significant economic and social difficulties and that these issues persist, despite government
intervention, ongoing investment and the considerable efforts of many stakeholders to effect the
transformation of the area.

Spatial Portrait

2.81 The sub-region’s topography and historical development has meant that the conurbation has
developed as an unusual collection of distinct but connected settlements rather than a conventional
single centre city structure. However the nature of this settlement pattern has, to some extent, amplified
the adverse impacts of several decades of economic decline, decentralisation of services and
employment, and out migration.

26

2.82 However, the Core Strategy also identifies the many assets of the area including: the valuable
canal network, serving the region's growing leisure and tourism industries; the historical landscapes,
townscapes and buildings of the sub region, which are irreplaceable, not only for their intrinsic
architectural and aesthetic value and their contribution towards creating a collective sense of place
and civic pride, but also for their contribution towards making the sub-region an economically attractive
and competitive focus for inward investment.
2.83 The North Staffordshire Green Belt surrounds Stoke and Newcastle with its northernmost
extent covering part of Cheshire East (known locally as the South Cheshire Green Belt) – south of
Alsager and Congleton and south east of Crewe.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

2.84 Housing regeneration continues as a key policy initiative in the Potteries despite the reduction
in government housing market renewal monies as there remains a high proportion of residential
properties in sub-standard condition.
2.85 Despite its economic difficulties, the Potteries is still a focus for employment. Travel-to-work
flows are particularly pronounced from the Cheshire East towns of Alsager, Congleton and Crewe.
(25)
Although with respect to the latter two towns, there is an even greater reverse flow .

Greater Manchester
2.86 Greater Manchester comprises the areas of ten Metropolitan Borough Councils. However the
main commercial focus is Manchester City Centre and the adjoining city of Salford. The City Centre
is the pre-eminent office, retail, cultural and educational location which has also seen substantial
residential development in recent years particularly in the form of apartments. Salford, particularly
the Quays area, has also experienced a great deal of regeneration particularly attracting media
industries and other cultural activities. Trafford Park (within Trafford Metropolitan Borough) is the
largest industrial estate in Europe.
2.87 The latest draft Greater Manchester Strategy identifies that Manchester’s population is the
fastest growing in the UK which presents a massive opportunity to link the jobs created with providing
places to live that encourage people to stay and contribute to success. But it also presents huge
challenges, including an ageing population and concentrations of unemployment coupled with low
skills. Planned changes to the welfare system mean that demand for services will only increase unless
there are radical reforms that improve the effectiveness of services, increasing the self-reliance of
Greater Manchester's residents and reducing demand for those services.
2.88 The south side of the Greater Manchester conurbation is generally quite affluent and includes
the substantial retail attraction of the Trafford Centre and nearby business opportunities at Trafford
Park and Carrington. Manchester Airport is the third largest UK airport and is already a major employer.
However this is set to increase significantly with the development of Airport City. Although the Airport
is linked to the M56 motorway, further road connections on the Stockport / Cheshire East boundary
are needed as part of the South East Manchester Multi Modal Strategy (SEMMMS) proposals. These
comprise the A6 to Manchester Airport Relief Road, but there are associated schemes, including
connecting to the Poynton Relief Road in Cheshire East.
2.89 Greater Manchester is surrounded by Green Belt, which, on the south side of the conurbation,
extends into Cheshire East covering the northern third of the borough and known locally as the North
Cheshire Green Belt.

2.91 Previous regional plans have placed a high priority on urban regeneration in Greater Manchester
with a particular focus on housing in the City Centre and nearby inner city areas, as well as the areas
that are suffering the most from de-population and derelict land in the north and east of the city. This
policy focus has been replicated in the Core Strategies of the relevant local authorities and inevitably
(due to the inherent lack of greenfield sites) is heavily dependent on the redevelopment of previously
developed land. Not surprisingly, the delivery of this policy approach was hit by the post-2007
recession, but in the immediately preceding years was remarkably successful. The latest draft of the
Greater Manchester Strategy considers a move away from the previous policy approach and seeks
to review the land supply to support growth in those locations most attractive to the market. This
recognises that failure to provide appropriate sites in areas where the market wants to invest, both
in housing and employment uses, risks Greater Manchester losing development and investment to
other areas.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Spatial Portrait

2.90 Manchester City Centre is a major travel to work destination from all around the conurbation
and beyond, including from the northern parts of Cheshire East. More locally, on the south side of
Greater Manchester, there are daily commuting movements into Cheshire East, especially to the high
technology and pharmaceutical industries in the north of the borough. Added to this mix are movements
associated with the Airport which are set to increase following the implementation of planned
developments.

27

Cheshire West and Chester
2.92 The Borough of Cheshire West and Chester was created in 2009 at the same time as Cheshire
East and is an area of wide contrasts. The generally affluent historic city of Chester is sub-regionally
important for its retail and visitor attractions. There are also numerous smaller towns that grew
significantly through industrial activity and each has pockets of deprivation, including Northwich and
Winsford. Both these towns developed from the on-going salt extraction industry and relate quite
closely to Cheshire East, especially Middlewich, in terms of access to local jobs and services.
2.93 The emerging Cheshire West and Chester Local Plan (Part One) aims to regenerate and
improve Northwich and Winsford and recognises the interdependence of these towns with Middlewich
that is encompassed by joint working through the Weaver Valley Partnership Board. The emerging
Cheshire West and Chester Local Plan also identifies an opportunity for housing development adjacent
to Middlewich on land within Cheshire West. However, it is presently considered that this site is not
required to meet Cheshire West and Chester's development needs. If such land is to be developed
in the future, then road improvements around the north of Middlewich (in Cheshire West) are likely
to be required.
2.94 It is recognised that there are cross boundary movements of waste in both directions between
Cheshire West and Chester and its neighbouring areas. The emerging Local Plan will identify sufficient
land to meet Cheshire West and Chester’s predicted waste management requirements and safeguard
consented waste management facilities including Kinderton Lodge near Middlewich. Mineral resources
of sand, gravel, salt and brine are extracted in Cheshire West and Chester and the emerging Local
Plan seeks to provide a continued supply of these, contributing to sub-national (regional) supply
guidelines.

Warrington
2.95 In 1968, Warrington was designated as a New Town, primarily to take economic advantage
of its unique position at the hub of the region's transportation network, evidently aided by the arrival
of the region's motorways. Warrington has evolved from being a medium-sized industrial town to the
home of major national and international companies.
2.96 The emerging Warrington Core Strategy highlights that since the end of the New Town era,
strategic planning policies have sought to arrest outward growth of the town. This is partly through
recognition that Warrington is nearing its natural limits of expansion and partly acknowledging that
the New Town development had remarkably little effect on the older urban areas of inner Warrington.
Recent efforts to date have therefore focused on regenerating and 'restructuring' the older core of
the town. The Warrington Core Strategy intends to continue with this approach and to help to create
a strong identity for the town.
2.97 Warrington attracts commuters from a wide area due to its high concentration of businesses
and good transport connectivity. However, the main flow involving Cheshire East is that of Warrington
(25)
residents travelling to work in Knutsford .

Spatial Portrait

Peak District, High Peak and Staffordshire Moorlands

28

2.98 The Peak District National Park covers parts of Derbyshire and Staffordshire as well as the
north eastern extremity of Cheshire East Borough. The National Park has its own planning authority
and development plans. The Peak District National Park is also a key tourism brand for Cheshire
East. The designation of the National Park excludes the main settlements in High Peak Borough.
The furthest north is Glossop which looks mainly towards Greater Manchester. New Mills and Whaley
Bridge are adjacent to the north east boundary of Cheshire East and do have linkages to Cheshire
East, particularly the Macclesfield area. They are also served by the A6, as is Chapel-en-le-Frith,
and will benefit from transport improvements identified by the A6 Corridor Study. Further south is the
spa town of Buxton which is a visitor attraction in its own right and one that is located close to Cheshire
East for day trips. The emerging High Peak Local Plan seeks to establish and consolidate Buxton
as England’s leading spa town.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

2.99 The proximity of the National Park is an important consideration for the location of future
development in both High Peak and Cheshire East as the landscape is an important tourist attraction
which helps the economy of both areas. Increased levels of development in the northern parts of
Cheshire East will serve to reduce pressure for growth in the High Peak area, helping to limit potential
increases in the use of the A6 particularly in the Disley area and impact on the setting of the National
Park.
2.100 The National Park is a complex tapestry of different landscapes but there are three distinct
areas: the less populated upland moorland areas and their fringes (the Dark Peak and Moorland
Fringes); the most populated lower-lying limestone grasslands and limestone dales and the Derwent
and Hope Valleys (the White Peak and Derwent Valley); and the sparsely populated mixed moorland
and grassland landscapes of the south west (the South West Peak).
2.101 The National Park Authority identifies challenges that broadly fall into seven closely related
themes:
Landscapes and conservation
Recreation and tourism
Climate change and sustainable building
Homes, shops and community facilities
Supporting economic development
Minerals
Accessibility, travel and traffic
2.102 In essence, the Park Authority is seeking to meet the everyday needs of local residents, as
well as catering for visitors, controlling mineral extraction and balancing all this with the task of
protecting the attractive landscape of the area.
2.103 Staffordshire Moorlands District is partially within the National Park but the area to the south
west that borders Cheshire East is outside the Peak District and is characterised by an orientation
mainly towards Stoke-on-Trent. The former mining town of Biddulph is the main settlement bordering
Cheshire East. The nearby Cheshire East towns provide a counter attraction for Biddulph residents
in terms of shops and services. The emerging Staffordshire Moorlands Core Strategy seeks to
strengthen and consolidate Biddulph town centre.

Shropshire

Spatial Portrait

2.104 Shropshire is a largely rural area. The Shropshire Core Strategy identifies the need for the
county’s market towns and rural settlements to become more sustainable places that are resilient to
st
meet the challenges of the 21 Century. The Core Strategy identifies five spatial zones reflecting the
individual distinctiveness of different parts of Shropshire; the north east zone borders Cheshire East.
Within this zone, Whitchurch is the nearest key settlement to Cheshire East with which it is well
connected by road and rail (it is on the Crewe to Cardiff line). Whitchurch has a range of services
including a community hospital and numerous local employers. There is a modest level of two way
commuting between Whitchurch and Nantwich / Crewe (and on to Manchester) and Shropshire
Council's strategy for Whitchurch provides significant levels of new employment land, including a
new business park to the south of the town, partly as an attempt to reverse this situation.

3 Duty to Co-operate
3.1 In preparing the Local Plan Strategy, the council complied with the 'Duty to Co-operate', as
introduced by the Localism Act 2011 and the National Planning Policy Framework. Activities undertaken
include:
Consultation with key stakeholders: the council has engaged and co-operated with the
prescribed organisations and authorities, as set out in the legislation and regulations, and in
compliance with its adopted Statement of Community Involvement;
Collaboration and cooperation in plan making: the council continues to work jointly with
partners to address key planning issues across the area; and
Consideration of cross boundary impacts: The council has engaged proactively with
neighbouring and other related authorities in considering and addressing strategic and site-specific
cross-boundary impacts arising from both Cheshire East's plans, and others' plans.
3.2 It should be noted that this Duty is an ongoing process and does not stop with the adoption of
the Local Plan Strategy. The on-going basis for future co-operation will vary according to the degree
of cross-boundary synergy that exists and the related extent of collaboration that is appropriate.
Where close joint working is needed the council will develop memoranda of understanding to formalise
relationships and guide future actions.
3.3 The council already has a strong and established record of commitment of collaboration and
cooperation with neighbouring authorities and other key stakeholders. For example, the council is
actively involved with the Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership on a range of
initiatives, has worked closely with Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council in relation to the former
Woodford Aerodrome development, and will continue to play an active role on groups relating to
Manchester Airport, HS2 and South East Manchester Multi Modal Study (SEMMMS).

Duty to Co-operate

3.4 Part of the role of the Local Plan Strategy is to address the wider implications of the local policy
approach and to manage cross-boundary effects together with those plans and strategies of other
authorities and agencies. A number of potential cross-boundary impacts have been taken into account
in the preparation of the Local Plan Strategy including:

32

Housing growth and regeneration - to ensure that Cheshire East provides for its own housing
needs, whilst limiting any impacts of this on the adjoining authorities' ability to regenerate their
own urban housing areas.
Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople - to assess the need for and provision of
accommodation.
Employment development - to ensure that Cheshire East provides sufficient employment land
to meet its own legitimate economic growth aspirations without undermining investment in
neighbouring areas.
Transport - to mitigate the congestion effects of development generated movements.
Green Belt - to minimise the loss of Green Belt land in the borough in ways consistent with the
sustainable location of new development and balanced with retaining the openness of the
countryside in the long term.
Infrastructure - to establish the means to provide for all the infrastructure needed to help deliver
the development proposed in the plan.
National Park / Recreation - to protect the natural attractions of the area and cater sensitively
for visitor trips.
Minerals - to ensure an appropriate supply of Cheshire East's key mineral resources is planned
for, including a contribution towards the North West's sub-national aggregate apportionment.
Waste - the need to deal appropriately with locally-generated waste in ways that minimise
dependence on neighbouring areas.
3.5 Progressive iterations of this plan have directly addressed specific cross boundary issues raised
by neighbouring authorities and consultees. Full details of the changes / shared understandings are
summarised below:

4 The Case for Growth
4.1 The government has stated that ‘Britain has lost ground in the world’s economy, and needs to
catch up. If we do not act now, jobs will be lost, our country will become poorer and we will find it
difficult to afford the public services we all want. If we do not wake up to the world around us, our
(27)
standard of living will fall, not rise' .
4.2 Cheshire East is at the heart of the largest single economic area outside of the capital with long
established linkages to the Manchester and Liverpool City Regions, North Staffordshire and North
Wales. Its connectivity and closeness to Manchester and Liverpool airports and its integral relationship
to the motorway network and West Coast Mainline makes the borough uniquely positioned to deliver
sustainable economic growth.
4.3 The top priority for Cheshire East Council is to increase the borough's economic and social
wellbeing in a way that is cohesive and sustainable. The Local Plan Strategy is therefore vital in
driving and supporting the development of jobs in the borough and the infrastructure and housing
that is needed to support that employment. Through the Local Plan, Cheshire East has to make sure
that there is sufficient land allocated for business, retail, leisure and other commercial developments
to ensure that jobs led growth is delivered.
The Case for Growth
Growth in Cheshire East is both necessary and beneficial for the following reasons:

The Case for Growth

To accord with the government's growth agenda and national planning policy
To help achieve the ambition of the Local Enterprise Partnership for Cheshire and Warrington
to be the best performing regional economy outside of the South East
To build upon the economic success of Cheshire East and attract more inward investment
To provide more diverse employment including well paid highly skilled jobs
To generate greater expenditure in local shops and services so spreading improved
prosperity to many local people
To provide a range of new homes including much needed affordable housing
To retain young people and attract suitably qualified employees to live and work locally,
limiting travel congestion
To provide more opportunities for skills and personal development
To help deliver much needed local regeneration schemes
To provide improved physical infrastructure and other services that are accessible to all
To provide improvements to the built and natural environment
To promote a thriving rural economy and tourism industry

36

4.4 The government has invited Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) to produce Strategic Economic
Plans (SEPs) for their areas as the basis of funding negotiations to drive economic growth. The
Cheshire and Warrington SEP includes a number of transformational projects in Cheshire East
including High Growth City, which focuses on linking Crewe and Macclesfield by way of Congleton
to create a ‘corridor of opportunity'. The sustainable growth aspirations set out in the Local Plan
Strategy are a key element in meeting the ambition of a LEP and fulfilling Cheshire East's sub-regional
role.
4.5 The economy of Cheshire East already makes an impressive contribution to the Gross Value
Added figures in the sub-region. The Gross Value Added (GVA) figure for Cheshire and Warrington
(28)
(29)
is around £21.9 billion
with the sub-region employing an estimated 444,100 people (as of 2012) .

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Cheshire East already makes an impressive contribution to the sub-regional and regional economies:
its GVA is around £9.2bn (2012 estimate), which equates to 7.0% of the North West region’s economic
output. As of 2012, an estimated 173,500 people were working in Cheshire East, as either employees
(29)
or working proprietors . The overall ambition of the Local Plan Strategy is to further strengthen the
borough's economy.
4.6 Cheshire East performs better than the regional and UK averages in skill levels, business start
ups and knowledge-based employment. The borough has major educational assets, in terms of skills
development and knowledge transfer, in the form of Manchester Metropolitan University at Crewe
and three Further Education colleges - South Cheshire, Reaseheath and Macclesfield. The council
also has aspirations for a University Technical College in Crewe. The Local Plan Strategy is therefore
growth orientated in order to retain and build upon Cheshire East's existing skills and knowledge
base, providing and building on the existing knowledge economy and high value jobs in the future.
4.7 The extent to which a location provides access to markets and a skilled workforce will impact
on attracting inward investment into an area. Individuals make decisions on where they wish to live,
taking into account the quality of housing and the environment. Consequently, the availability of good
housing and a high quality environment influence decisions about business location, investment and
growth. Increases in local expenditure on goods and services can also lead to further jobs being
created in the borough and overall increases in local prosperity.
4.8 If we do not provide sufficient housing, commercial or employment opportunities, economic
growth will be constrained because new businesses will decide not to locate in Cheshire East, whilst
house prices will increase, exacerbating the affordability problem. In areas of high cost housing,
employers have particular difficulty in recruiting to lower paid posts, restricting economic growth. The
consequences may be significant in personal and environmental terms with lower paid workers being
forced to live in areas of cheaper housing outside Cheshire East but travelling long distances into the
borough to work.
4.9 Furthermore, there are clear demographic challenges in the borough, with a declining proportion
of working age population. The Housing Development Study (2015) identifies that managing
demographic change will become an increasingly important issue, with the population in Cheshire
East of pensionable age and above continuing to grow from 70,300 in 2010 to 115,900 by 2030. In
order to support these demographic changes, growth is required to attract inward investment, to retain
people of working age in the borough and attract new people of working age to live in Cheshire East.
This will in turn increase the amount of disposable income in the borough to support local services,
town centres and the vitality and vibrancy of local communities.

4.11 Housing development also makes an important contribution to the local economy in its own
right. It creates employment and skills development opportunities for construction workers and also
generates increased retail expenditure in the local community. The Centre for Economics and Business
Research has estimated that if new housebuilding across the UK were to rise to 300,000 annually
by 2015 (95,000 new houses were built in 2010), it would add some 201,000 extra permanent jobs
in construction and contribute £75 billion to the UK's Gross Domestic Product.
4.12 The NPPF (March 2012) states that the planning system should: 'proactively drive and support
sustainable economic development to deliver the homes, businesses and industrial units, infrastructure
and thriving local places that the country needs. Every effort should be made objectively to identify
and then meet the housing, business and other development needs of an area, and respond positively
to wider opportunities for growth. Plans should take account of market signals, such as land prices
and housing affordability, and set out a clear strategy for allocating sufficient land which is suitable

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

The Case for Growth

4.10 An adequate supply of a range of housing plays a fundamental role in building a successful
economy. Despite the recent economic recession, our evidence shows that need for housing over
the next 20 years is likely to outstrip supply unless we increase the amount of new housing provided
through the Local Plan Strategy, in particular housing that meets local needs and is affordable to
people who should live or work in the borough.

37

for development in their area, taking into account the needs of the residential and business
communities'.
4.13 The Local Plan Strategy seeks to enable growth through providing a range of sustainably
located development sites that are attractive to economic investment. The Local Plan Strategy also
brings forward at an early stage the necessary infrastructure that services new sites and facilitates
more efficient use of existing commercial premises. It also sets out how the council will use its own
land and financial resources to deliver sustainable economic growth in the borough. Policies in the
Local Plan Strategy will safeguard existing businesses and encourage inward investment into the
borough supporting the promotion of the Borough as a place to do business.
4.14 A strong economy offering sustainable growth is essential in maintaining the borough’s
prosperity in a fast changing world. However, it is important that economic growth achieves the other
elements of sustainable development as set out in the NPPF.
4.15 The Local Plan Strategy, as the spatial expression of the borough council's Sustainable
Community Strategy, will deliver on a number of key priorities for action, including creating the
conditions for business growth, unlocking the potential of towns (in particular Crewe and Macclesfield),
supporting young people whilst preparing for an increasingly older population, and ensuring a
sustainable future by providing appropriate housing, employment land, infrastructure and community
facilities to meet future needs. The Local Plan Strategy will also deliver a number of the outcomes
set by the council's Three Year Plan (2013 to 2016) including promoting local communities as strong
and supportive, providing a strong and resilient economy, promoting a green and sustainable place
and a good place to live and work.
4.16 The council’s objective is not economic growth at any price; rather it is the sustainable
development of Cheshire East. Sustainable development concerns the effective balance of economic,
social and environmental factors; in many ways these factors are intertwined as the attractive
environment of the borough is key to its economic success. If the attractive environment were to be
degraded there would be both social and economic repercussions.

The Case for Growth

4.17 Accordingly, the aspiration of the Local Plan Strategy is to secure future economic prosperity
but to do so in harmony with the existing characteristics and strengths of the borough wherever
possible. On occasion, however, the implication of growth is that new policies and proposals are
required in response. The Local Plan Strategy contains bold proposals for new communities in
locations across Cheshire East as a better means of meeting future development needs. Equally,
revisions to the Green Belt are necessary for towns such as Macclesfield to maintain their role and
status – a departure from past policies of development constraint at any cost.

38

4.18 The NPPF requires that plans be aspirational but realistic; furthermore they should address
the spatial implications of changes on economy, society and the environment. Whilst the policies of
the plan will inevitably be time limited, the proposals within it, for new development and infrastructure
will endure for much longer. In many ways, the developments planned now will only mature in the
2030s or 2040s. Planning ahead over a 30 to 40 year time horizon is seldom easy; indeed some
would question whether the conventional model of economic growth that underpins much of the plan
st
will remain valid by the middle of the 21 Century. Some might even suggest that the continuing rise
of world population combined with advancing climate change point to an altogether more challenging
future in which competition for diminishing food, water and fuel resources predominates.
4.19
Sustainable development is therefore the best preparation for a future whose defining
characteristic is uncertainty. The Local Plan Strategy unashamedly promotes economic development
– but does so in a way that builds upon existing strengths wherever possible. New development will
be necessary, but environmental assets will be protected wherever possible.
4.20 Therefore the plan seeks to consolidate on what is best about the borough – but this is not a
plan for standing still – it is forward thinking, determined to plan effectively for future needs, and
dedicated to providing new and innovative solutions where appropriate.

5 Vision
5.1 Economic prosperity is fundamental to a healthy and sustainable borough. In order to pursue
wider community goals of providing good quality and affordable housing, building a better, more
sustainable transport system, providing improved community facilities, improving educational attainment
and investing in our vibrant town centres, a strong economy is absolutely vital.
5.2
It is also recognised that the borough’s outstanding environment, including its attractive
countryside, its vibrant market towns and villages and its many heritage assets, is highly valued by
residents and also plays an important part in attracting inward investment.
5.3 With these principles in mind, the Local Plan Strategy sets out how a stronger economy and
sufficient housing of the right type to meet our future needs will be delivered in a way that is appropriate
environmentally and socially.
5.4 To accommodate the needed growth in jobs and houses, new development is necessary. The
Local Plan Strategy will make sure that development takes place in areas that are well connected to
existing urban areas; that incorporates green infrastructure and the latest building technology,
generates a minimal carbon footprint; promotes waste recycling; and enables healthy living.
5.5 The pursuit of sustainability in Cheshire East does not mean stopping urban change or
employment growth; it means growing at a sensible pace, with as low as practical environmental
impact and reduced waste, in a community that is economically robust, which can deliver the services
and infrastructure that residents need, and that promotes the well-being of all of its citizens.

Vision

5.6 The Local Plan Strategy is one of jobs led growth, focusing particularly on the two Principal
Towns of Crewe and Macclesfield, and the larger towns that form Key Service Centres. Growth,
however, should not be at the expense of the attractive environment that is, of course, a key asset
in drawing investment to the borough. Good quality, well designed, sustainable development is
therefore at the heart of the Local Plan Strategy and vision for the borough.

Vision for Cheshire East in 2030
In 2030 and beyond, Cheshire East will be an economically prosperous area, with a well educated
and skilled labour force benefiting from a strong and diverse employment base and high
employment levels. It will continue to benefit from its strategic location close to the Greater
Manchester and Potteries conurbations and adjoining the Peak District National Park, with
excellent road and rail links to the rest of the country. Based on its landscape and heritage assets
and historic market towns, the importance of the area as a visitor and tourism destination will
have increased.
Cheshire East will continue to be a desirable place to live, with a beautiful, bio-diverse and
productive countryside and unique towns and villages, each with their own identity and character
influenced by such factors as the silk industry, salt extraction, our agricultural heritage and
associated historic markets, the growth of the railways and many other factors that result in a
wealth of history and culture.
Well designed new employment and housing development will have been developed to fully
meet identified needs in locations that reduce the need to travel. The infrastructure to support
this growth will have been delivered in partnership with other organisations, whilst maximising
and enhancing those built and natural features most valued across the borough. In the main,
new development will have been directed to the Principal Towns of Crewe and Macclesfield to
support regeneration priorities, and to the Key Service Centres of the borough which provide a
good range of services and facilities. In addition, a new sustainable village will have been created
in the north of the borough, which will provide a new economic focus, benefiting from its closeness
to Manchester Airport and Greater Manchester. This development will help meet housing needs
for the borough and provide a range of community infrastructure in a well designed, sustainable
and green environment.
Stronger and safer communities will have been created with a high quality of life, good access
to education, jobs, services, shops and public transport and an appropriate range of housing to
meet its needs, including those of an ageing population. People will lead healthy and active
lifestyles benefiting from improved access to sporting facilities, high quality open spaces, play
areas, allotments and the open countryside. A green infrastructure network will have been created,
increasing the provision of accessible green spaces, supporting flora, fauna and improving
general wellbeing.
Cheshire East will have made a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions and tackling
climate change through the high energy efficiency of new and existing buildings; generation of
renewable energy; and sustainable patterns of development that enable a high proportion of
people to travel by public transport, cycle or on foot. Extensively available fast telecommunications
links will have enabled business users to efficiently work wherever they are located.
The supply of important natural mineral resources such as silica sand and salt will be achieved
in the most sustainable way possible. Waste will be reduced and managed sustainably; being
utilised as a resource wherever possible.

Vision

Our many areas of landscape value, sites of nature conservation importance, characteristic
waterways and heritage assets will have been conserved, and enhanced through appropriate
development that recognises the importance of both designated and non-designated assets
within their setting and safeguarding them for future generations.

7 Presumption in Favour of Sustainable
Development
7.1 The World Commission on Environment and Development defined sustainable development
as ‘development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability for future
generations to meet their own needs’ (Bruntland Commission, 1987). The concept of sustainable
development acknowledges that we must develop both economically and socially, but in a way that
is in accordance with a whole range of environmental concerns including nature conservation, energy
efficiency, conserving future resources, purity of air, earth and water, archaeology, agricultural land,
landscape and countryside protection.
7.2
The NPPF foreword states that 'the purpose of planning is to help achieve sustainable
development. Sustainable means ensuring that better lives for ourselves don't mean worse lives for
future generations. Development means growth . . . So sustainable development is about positive
growth - making economic, environmental and social progress for this and future generations'.
7.3 There are three dimensions to sustainable development: economic, social and environmental.
The NPPF clarifies that these roles should not be undertaken in isolation, because they are mutually
dependent. Therefore, to achieve sustainable development, economic, social and environmental
gains should be sought jointly and simultaneously through the planning system.

Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development

7.4 The Framework goes on to confirm that there should be a presumption in favour of sustainable
development, which all plans should be based upon and reflect this presumption with clear policies
to guide how the presumption will be applied locally.

48

7.5 The Cheshire East Local Plan Strategy is a positive, pro-growth strategy that seeks to deliver
the amount of development required in the borough up to 2030 in a sustainable way. It is consistent
and in general conformity with the NPPF. For the avoidance of doubt this is set out in the following
overarching, all embracing policy on the achievement of sustainable development.

Policy MP 1
Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development

When considering development proposals the council will take a positive approach that
reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development contained in the National
Planning Policy Framework. It will always work proactively with applicants to find joint
solutions which mean that proposals can be approved wherever possible, and to secure
development that improves the economic, social and environmental conditions in the area.
Planning applications that accord with the policies in the Development Plan (and, where
relevant, with policies in Neighbourhood Plans) will be approved without delay, unless
material considerations indicate otherwise.
Where there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are out of date
at the time of making the decision, the council will grant permission, unless material
considerations indicate otherwise, taking into account whether:
i.

ii.

Any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably
outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the National Planning
Policy Framework taken as a whole; or
Specific policies in that Framework indicate that development should be restricted.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Justification
7.6 The National Planning Policy Framework contains a Presumption in Favour of Sustainable
Development. This presumption is considered to be the golden thread running through both plan
making and decision taking. The Local Plan Strategy is the principal planning policy document for
the Cheshire East Local Plan (the Development Plan) and therefore reflects the National Planning
Policy Framework in making clear that development which is considered sustainable will be approved
without delay.
7.7 Policy MP 1 makes sure that the Local Plan Strategy is based upon the Presumption in Favour
of Sustainable Development, as required by the National Planning Policy Framework. The policies
in the Local Plan Strategy provide clear guidance on how the Presumption in Favour of Sustainable
Development will be applied locally.
7.8 The Local Plan Strategy policies will be supplemented by the Saved Local Plan Policies (in
accordance with their consistency with the National Planning Policy Framework) until they are replaced
by policies in the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document and the Minerals and Waste
Development Plan Document. Should Neighbourhood Plans be produced in the borough (in conformity
with the contents of the Local Plan Strategy) then their policies will also be relevant.
7.9 Further policies setting out how sustainable development principles will be applied in Cheshire
East are included in Chapter 9 'Planning for Sustainable Development'.

8 Planning for Growth
8.1 One of the core principles of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is that planning
should 'proactively drive and support sustainable economic development to deliver the homes,
business and industrial units, infrastructure and thriving local places that the country needs. Every
effort should be made objectively to identify and then meet the housing, business and other
development needs of an area, and respond positively to wider opportunities for growth. Plans should
take account of market signals, such as land prices and housing affordability, and set out a clear
strategy for allocating sufficient land which is suitable for development in their area, taking account
of the needs of the residential and business communities'.
8.2 The NPPF also states that Local Plans should meet objectively assessed needs unless there
would be significant adverse impacts or where the NPPF indicates development should be restricted.
Key evidence of need in relation to the economy includes the Employment Land Review and local
business surveys, whilst population forecasts and other key evidence to assess housing need and
capacity has come from the Housing Development Study 2015 and the Strategic Housing Land
Availability Assessment (SHLAA) 2012.

8.4 The Employment Land Review and the Alignment of Economic, Employment and Housing
Strategy Report (2015) are the primary sources of evidence related to the requirements for employment
land. They use a variety of methods to forecast the requirements for new employment land up to
2030. The Employment Land Review considers the annual average rates of take-up of employment
land over the past 25 years, as well as forecasting future demand for employment land using
econometric data and population forecasts. It also looks at the annual average amount of employment
land lost to other uses over the past 15 years.
8.5 Using all the available information, and in accordance with the 2004 ODPM Guidance Note on
Employment Land Reviews, the study gives a range for the amount of employment land that will be
required between 2009 and 2030. This range is between 278 hectares and 324 hectares, which
includes a flexibility factor of 30% to reflect Cheshire East's aspirations for employment-led growth.
8.6 The Alignment of Economic, Employment & Housing Strategy Report (AEEHS) (2015) used
updated econometric projections, which pointed to a significantly greater employment growth rate
over the plan period than the Employment Land Review’s econometric projections did. The AEEHS

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

used a methodology that is largely in line with the assumptions and approaches used in the
Employment Land Review, but concluded that a 20% flexibility factor was more appropriate, given
the use of more optimistic employment forecasts. The AEEHS results suggest employment land
totalling 378 hectares will be required over the plan period.

Homes
8.8 The housing requirement set out in Policy PG 1 responds to the Housing Development Study
(2015) and aims to meet the full objectively assessed need for an additional 36,000 dwellings that is
predicted to arise in Cheshire East over the 2010 – 2030 period. The Housing Development Study
has used the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) 2012-based household
projections as a ‘starting point’ and applied a 10-year migration trend. The study also projected
economic activity rates up to 2030 and assumed that there are no further falls in unemployment. It
considered the evidence on market signals along with the need for affordable housing and for older
people (including C2 bed spaces). It then sought to identify the appropriate balance – between working
residents and the number of people working in the borough – that is necessary to achieve jobs growth
of around 31,000 (an average of 0.7% jobs growth a year). Such a balance requires both migration
flows and commuting flows to be sustainable over the plan period.
8.9 The Housing Development Study concludes that Cheshire East is an appropriate geography
for planning purposes over which to assess and meet housing requirements. The study also concludes
that Cheshire East comprises two functional sub-market areas suggested by the data to reflect the
former Macclesfield Borough and a second sub-area reflecting the former Crewe & Nantwich and
Congleton areas.
8.10 The CLG 2012-based household projections (period 2012-2037) were used as the ‘starting
point’ for determining the objectively assessed need for housing. This links in with paragraphs 15
and 16 of the Planning Practice Guidance which makes clear that:
“Household projections published by the Department for Communities and Local
Government should provide the starting point estimate of overall housing need”.
(PPG 2015, Paragraph 15)

Employment sites that were in the employment land supply on this date but are now proposed for alternative uses in
this Local Plan Strategy are not included in this figure

Planning for Growth

“The 2012-2037 Household Projections were published on the 27 February 2015, and are the
most up to date estimate of future household growth”. (PPG 2015, Paragraph 16)

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

53

8.11 Following the completion of the Housing Development Study (2015), the council, in line with
the Planning Practice Guidance (ID-2a-016), has considered the latest available information from the
2014-based household projections (period 2014-2039) published by CLG in July 2016. These represent
a modest reduction which does not warrant a change to the planned approach in the dwellings
projection set out in Policy PG 1 'Overall Development Strategy'.

30

8.12 Having taken the CLG 2012-based projections as its ‘starting point’, the Housing Development
Study tested alternative migration trends, concluding that a 10-year migration trend best represented
long-term change. The study also projected economic activity rates up to 2030, based on Census
data for Cheshire East and Office for Budget Responsibility projections. It assumes that unemployment
stays at its March 2015 level and makes allowances for vacancies, second homes and “double-jobbing”
(people holding multiple jobs). The study also considered the latest evidence on market signals (as
required by Planning Practice Guidance). In doing so, it used Office for National Statistics area
classification data and CLG Index of Multiple Deprivation data to identify areas with similar demographic
and economic characteristics to Cheshire East. The market signals analysis compared Cheshire East
to these areas - Cheshire West & Chester, the East Riding of Yorkshire, Wiltshire and North Somerset
– and to England. The study identified that, on the whole, market signals do not indicate any need
for an upward adjustment to housing need: house price trends and affordability trends in Cheshire
East are close to those for England and are typically in line with those for the comparator areas;
average rents and increases in rents are broadly in line with England and the comparator areas; the
proportion of households that are overcrowded is lower than in England (and most comparator areas)
and rose more slowly during 2001-11 than in most of these other areas; and whilst the rate of
development has been relatively low in recent years, it was higher than the England average for
2001-11. Nevertheless, there has been an increase in concealed families over the period 2001-11,
which the objective assessment of housing need has addressed, and homelessness - by increasing
projected household growth by 344 (an average of 17 per annum) over the plan period (2010-2030).
The study identifies a total affordable housing need of a minimum of 7,100 dwellings (an average of
355 per annum), which is included in the objective assessment of housing need of at least 36,000
dwellings.
8.13 The Alignment of Economic, Employment and Housing Strategy Report concluded that net
jobs growth of around 31,400 jobs would be ambitious yet realistic for the 20-year period (2010-2030);
this represents a jobs growth rate of around 0.7% per annum. This is consistent with Cheshire East’s
previous long-term economic performance, the council’s Local Plan Strategy and the economic growth
vision of the Cheshire & Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership.

Planning for Growth

8.14 The Housing Development Study notes that, in meeting any shortfall in workers over the plan
period, there has to be an appropriate balance between migration flows and commuting flows, to
ensure that both are sustainable over the long term. Based on the assumption that net in-migration
will average 2,600 per annum over the 20 year plan period (which is equivalent to the highest level
recorded in any single year since 1991 and considerably greater than the 2001-11 average of around
1,700 per annum), net in-commuting would need to increase by an average of 400 commuters per
annum over the same period. On this basis, net commuting would rise from 1,400 (at the time of the
2011 Census) to around 9,000 by 2030; to put this in context, the number of jobs located in Cheshire
East is projected to rise by around 31,000, from 197,000 to 228,000 over the plan period, so even in
2030 net commuting would account for less than 5% of the total projected jobs. Considering all of
the evidence, the Housing Development Study has concluded that the objectively assessed need for
housing in Cheshire East is 36,000 dwellings over the plan period (2010-2030). It is also important
to recognise that, as well as yielding extra population and workers, any increase in housing will also
help to address market signals and increase the likely provision of affordable housing.

54

8.15 The outputs from the Housing Development Study work represent only one of the elements
that have been considered by the council in determining its housing requirement. The council has
also considered the findings of the Alignment of Economic, Employment and Housing Strategy Report
(2015), the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA), the pre-recession levels of
house building and other wider policy considerations before determining what the appropriate housing
requirement is for Cheshire East.
8.16 Around 2,200 sites were considered as part of the Strategic Housing Land Availability
Assessment (Update 31 March 2012). Of these approximately 1,600 sites were considered suitable
for housing during the following 15 years. These 'suitable' sites could potentially provide a total of
nearly 50,000 dwellings over the 15 year period, of which about 7,200 homes would be on brownfield
sites with a further 4,800 on sites that are a mix of brownfield and greenfield land. This work
demonstrates a theoretical capacity for new housing in the borough. An updated assessment of

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

housing permissions and commitments has been completed to a base date of 31 March 2016. This
has been used to inform a housing trajectory for the plan period which does include the envisaged
delivery timing of all the sites proposed in the plan. The trajectory is reproduced in Appendix E.
8.17 Using an overall housing need target of 36,000 dwellings for the borough over the plan period
would equate to an average net increase of around 1,800 dwellings per annum. Setting this annual
level to apply from 2010 is a significant step change in the housing requirement for the area compared
with past policy requirements. However this overall level of housing is considered necessary and
appropriate to meet the council and government’s growth agenda. In arriving at this total figure,
consideration has been given to the capacity of the area to accommodate growth and an appropriate
balance has been struck which minimises the impact on the environment, infrastructure and the Green
Belt, whilst providing for objectively assessed needs. It is considered that a significantly higher growth
strategy for housing, to facilitate even greater economic growth, would be unsustainable in overall
terms as it would have an unacceptable impact on the local environment, the intended role of the
Green Belt and the cumulative capacity of local infrastructure.
8.18 The council fully intends to meet the requirement of delivering 36,000 dwellings over the plan
period, taking into consideration a number of key components of supply, which includes commitments
(as at 31 March 2016), completions (between 01 April 2010 and 31 March 2016), contributions from
Strategic Sites and Locations, proposed Site Allocations and Development Policies Document and
a small sites windfall allowance. The full extent of these contributions and their role in meeting and
exceeding the housing requirement (allowing for a robust level of plan flexibility) is summarised below
and set out fully within Appendix E.

8.19 The overall basis of the plan is to enable economic growth in Cheshire East. The local economy
suffered, along with the rest of the country, during the recent recession. The annual rate of house
building dipped to a low of less than 500 dwellings in 2010/11 compared to the annualised development
plan target of 1,150 applicable at the time. This contraction in the house building industry is shown
in starker terms when the new annualised average figure of 1,800 is applied immediately from 2010.
The selection of land for residential development within the site allocations will need to take account
of both the overall housing requirement and the need to redress past shortfalls in delivery since 2010.

8.20 As part of considering options to removing land from the Green Belt, collaboration working
with neighbouring authorities has explored the extent to which such authorities could assist in meeting
Cheshire East’s housing requirements. The outcome of those discussions is that none of these
authorities are in such a position.
8.21 Further information in relation to the housing completions and commitments is set out in
Appendix A: 'Proposed Growth Distribution'.

Settlement Hierarchy and Visions
8.22 It is important to make sure that the places where development takes place have good access
to jobs, health and community services, education, shops, leisure, open space, and sport and recreation
facilities. If it is easy to walk, cycle or use public transport to get to facilities, the number and length
of car journeys and carbon dioxide emissions (the primary cause of global climate change), can be
reduced. For that reason, the bulk of new development should take place in Principal Towns and Key
Service Centres where access to services is generally easier.

Principal Towns
8.23 The Principal Towns of Crewe and Macclesfield provide opportunities for employment, retail
and education, and allow access to services. They serve a large catchment area with high levels of
accessibility and public transport provision. The two towns have a distinct history, character and urban
form, and both provide opportunities for sustainable future jobs led growth. The town centres of both
Crewe and Macclesfield will be the main focus for high quality convenience and comparison retail,
supported by a range of services, leisure, tourism, office and other town centre uses, including
residential.
Crewe
8.24 The key objective for Crewe is to take advantage of its prime location for connectivity and
significantly increase the amount and type of employment that is available in the town. Crewe and
its surrounding area are situated in a unique location that is attractive to investors. The town is a
strategic gateway to the North West, with excellent communication links to other parts of the country
by road, rail and air (via Manchester Airport). Crewe also benefits from an advanced engineering /
manufacturing skills base and a supply of available development land.
8.25 The All Change for Crewe and High Growth City regeneration initiatives set out ambitious
plans for Crewe's growth, with the aim of making it a nationally significant economic centre by 2030.

Planning for Growth

Vision for Crewe

56

By 2030, as a gateway to the North West, Crewe will be a nationally significant economic centre;
one of the leading advanced engineering and manufacturing centres in England; and a
sought-after place to live and do business in Cheshire. Crewe will be recognised for its vibrant
and diverse knowledge based economy; high quality communication and sustainable transport
linkages; many physical development opportunities; attractive heritage, environmental and cultural
assets that contribute to liveability; and its high quality image and perception generated through
strong leadership.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Macclesfield
8.26 Macclesfield is the borough's second largest town and the main town in the north of Cheshire
East, with strong economic links to South Manchester.
8.27 An Economic Masterplan for the town was adopted by the council in 2010 with the aim of
sustaining the town’s performance as one of the most successful in the regional economy. The
Masterplan identified two key elements for the future success of the town. Firstly, the redevelopment
of the town centre to provide a greater retail offer, and secondly, the delivery of the South Macclesfield
Development Area providing opportunities for physical and economic development.

Vision for Macclesfield
By 2030, Macclesfield will continue to be a unique, distinctive and appealing destination set in
a visible landscape setting, with a vital and vibrant town centre, where the community comes
together to enjoy a wide range of facilities and events, along with its rich history and heritage
assets. It will be a town where businesses thrive and where there is a good range of shopping
and leisure activities both during the day and the evening. It will be a safe and desirable place
with sustainable development, where people want to come to live, work and play. Our vision for
employment sees Macclesfield as the centre of bio science manufacturing in Europe; this will
be focused at the current AstraZeneca site in Hurdsfield.

Key Service Centres
8.28 Cheshire East is characterised by its distinctive historic towns each with their own history,
character and charm. These towns lie at the heart of the borough, and their vitality and growth is
essential for the future prosperity of Cheshire East. These towns serve as Key Service Centres for
a wider locality with a good range of facilities including shops, schools, and cultural and leisure
facilities.
8.29 The Key Service Centres of Alsager, Congleton, Handforth, Knutsford, Middlewich, Nantwich,
Poynton, Sandbach and Wilmslow provide a range of services and opportunities for employment,
retail and education. They serve a wide catchment area and contain public transport links. The Key
Service Centres will deliver sustainable economic growth that can meet the aspirations of the borough
and local communities.

Vision for Key Service Centres

Planning for Growth

The Key Service Centres will see growth, with high quality homes and business premises provided,
where smaller independent traders and tourism initiatives will continue to thrive and where all
development will contribute to creating a strong sense of place.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Local Service Centres
8.30 The Local Service Centres of Alderley Edge, Audlem, Bollington, Bunbury, Chelford, Disley,
Goostrey, Haslington, Holmes Chapel, Mobberley, Prestbury, Shavington and Wrenbury provide a
range of services and facilities that help meet the needs of local people, including those living in
nearby settlements. Each has a primary school and, in the case of Holmes Chapel and Shavington,
a secondary school. Alderley Edge has one private secondary school for girls. In many cases, they
also have a limited range of shops, health and leisure facilities, and employment opportunities. New
development is required to meet local needs and help retain services and facilities so that residents
can continue to enjoy these benefits and reduce the need to travel elsewhere. This may require small
scale alterations to the Green Belt in some circumstances, which will be pursued as necessary through
the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document.

Vision for Local Service Centres
In the Local Service Centres, some modest growth in housing and employment will have taken
place to meet locally arising needs and priorities, to reduce the level of out-commuting and to
secure their continuing vitality. This may require small scale alterations to the Green Belt in some
circumstances.

Other Settlements and Rural Areas
8.31 The remaining settlements have fewer facilities than the Local Service Centres, if any. As a
result, people living in these communities generally have to travel to larger centres for jobs, schools,
health care and other services. New development in these settlements will help to sustain these local
services.

Vision for Other Settlements and Rural Areas
By 2030, some small scale residential and employment development will have taken place in
these settlements, to help to retain and sustain local services and to reduce the need to travel.

Planning for Growth

The rural economy will have grown stronger and diversified, based primarily on agriculture but
supplemented by appropriate small-scale tourism and visitor facilities in appropriate locations,
food related businesses, recreation and other knowledge-based rural businesses, making use
of ICT connectivity. At the same time, our many areas of landscape value, sites of nature
conservation importance and heritage assets and their settings will have been maintained and
enhanced.

Settlement Hierarchy
Policy PG 2
Settlement Hierarchy
Principal Towns
In the Principal Towns of Crewe and Macclesfield, significant development will be encouraged
to support their revitalisation, recognising their roles as the most important settlements in the
borough. Development will maximise the use of existing infrastructure and resources to allow
jobs, homes and other facilities to be located close to each other and accessible by public
transport.
Key Service Centres
In the Key Service Centres, development of a scale, location and nature that recognises and
reinforces the distinctiveness of each individual town will be supported to maintain their vitality
and viability.
The Key Service Centres are Alsager, Congleton, Handforth, Knutsford, Middlewich, Nantwich,
Poynton, Sandbach and Wilmslow.
Local Service Centres
In the Local Service Centres, small scale development to meet needs and priorities will be
supported where they contribute to the creation and maintenance of sustainable communities.
The Local Service Centres are Alderley Edge, Audlem, Bollington, Bunbury, Chelford, Disley,
Goostrey, Haslington, Holmes Chapel, Mobberley, Prestbury, Shavington and Wrenbury.
Other Settlements and Rural Areas
In the interests of sustainable development and the maintenance of local services, growth and
investment in the other settlements should be confined to proportionate development at a scale
commensurate with the function and character of the settlement and confined to locations well
related to the existing built-up extent of the settlement. It may be appropriate for local needs to
be met within larger settlements, dependent on location.

Justification

8.33 Locating the majority of new development needs in, on the edge of, or close to the borough’s
Principal Towns and Key Service Centres will enable the maximum use of existing infrastructure and
resources and allow homes, jobs and other facilities to be located close to each other. This has the
potential to reduce the amount of people reliant on travel by car and can support existing public
transport modes. The Principal Towns and Key Service Centres also have the greatest potential to
generate economic growth.
8.34 In Local Service Centres and other settlements and rural areas, the Local Plan Strategy
approach is to support an appropriate level of small scale development that reflects the function and
character of individual villages. Small scale growth may be appropriate where it supports the creation
of stronger local communities and where a clear need exists, which is not more appropriately met in
a larger nearby settlement. Development will be restricted to locations well related to the built-up

extent of these settlements. The identification of such sites will achieved through the allocation of
suitable sites and / or the designation of settlement boundaries addressed as part of the Site Allocations
and Development Policies Development Plan Document and / or in Neighbourhood Plans, where
these come forward. In the case of Goostrey which adjoins Holmes Chapel, a larger Local Service
Centre, it is anticipated that development needs will largely be provided for in Holmes Chapel.
8.35 The Local Plan Strategy also includes the North Cheshire Growth Village at Handforth. This
new village will be designed to the highest environmental standards, acting as best practice examples
for future design and construction. It will embody sustainable development principles including:
High quality amenities including shops, schools and sports facilities
A network of green open spaces, parks and gardens
Employment opportunities close at hand
Renewable on-site energy production capable of supplying heat and power to every home where
appropriate
User-friendly public transport systems, encouraging people to use buses, cycles and walkways
Efficient recycling and waste management
8.36 The National Planning Policy Framework states 'the supply of new homes can sometimes be
best achieved through planning for larger scale development, such as new settlements or extensions
to existing villages and towns that follow the principles of Garden Cities. Working with the support of
their communities, local planning authorities should consider whether such opportunities provide the
best way of achieving sustainable development. In doing so, they should consider whether it is
appropriate to establish Green Belt around or adjoining any such new development'.
8.37 The Local Plan Strategy also includes Other Local Plan Strategy Sites at Wardle Employment
Improvement Area and Alderley Park Opportunity Site. At Alderley Park Opportunity Site, residential
development may come forward where it is demonstrated to be necessary for the delivery of the life
science park, in accordance with Local Plan Strategy Site LPS 61.
Key Evidence
1.

Determining the Settlement Hierarchy

Green Belt and Safeguarded Land

Planning for Growth

8.38 The council recognises the important role of the Green Belt in the borough, particularly in
preventing its towns and settlements from merging into one another, safeguarding the countryside
and concentrating development into its urban areas. The National Planning Policy Framework states
that 'the fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently
open; the essential characteristics of Green Belts are their openness and permanence'.

60

8.39 Cheshire East has around 400 square kilometres of land designated as Green Belt, located
in the northern and south-eastern parts of the borough. These form part of the Green Belts surrounding
Greater Manchester and the Potteries conurbations. Within the southern and eastern parts of the
borough, all of our major settlements are located beyond the outer edge of the Green Belt surrounding
the Potteries. However, in the north of the borough, the Green Belt surrounding Greater Manchester
is much wider and a number of significant settlements are inset within the Green Belt. Historically,
the Green Belt boundaries were drawn very tightly around these settlements, leaving little space for
future development.
8.40 Draft proposals for Green Belt in the area were first drawn up in the 1960s to prevent the
outward spread of development from Greater Manchester and the Potteries. Detailed boundaries
for the North Cheshire Green Belt were defined through a series of Local Plans in the 1980s and
detailed boundaries for the South Cheshire Green Belt were defined in the 1980s and early 1990s.
8.41 The general extent of the existing Green Belt will be maintained, but to achieve sustainable
development over a period of several decades, some alterations to the detailed Green Belt boundaries

8.42 As set out in Chapter 4 'The Case for Growth' and Policy PG 1 'Overall Development Strategy',
and evidenced through the Housing Development Study (2015), the Employment Land Review (2012)
and the Alignment of Economic, Employment and Housing Strategy Report (2015) there are significant
identified needs for market and affordable housing, as well as for new employment land provision
within Cheshire East.

62

8.43 The National Planning Policy Framework requires that 'Local planning authorities should
positively seek opportunities to meet the development needs of their area' and that 'Local Plans
should meet objectively assessed needs, with sufficient flexibility to adapt to rapid change, unless:
(i) any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when
assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole; or (ii) specific policies in this
Framework indicate development should be restricted''.

33

As defined in the Borough of Crewe and Nantwich Local Plan, the Congleton Borough Local Plan and the Macclesfield
Borough Local Plan

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

8.44 The National Planning Policy Framework also states 'Once established, Green Belt boundaries
should only be altered in exceptional circumstances, through the preparation or review of the Local
Plan'.
8.45 The Green Belt Assessment Update (2015) has considered the contribution each parcel of
Green Belt land adjoining settlement boundaries makes to the purposes of the Green Belt. In the
north of the borough, there is very little scope to meet these needs from towns and villages inset
within the Green Belt boundary, or from urban areas inside the Green Belt boundary. As set out in
the Green Belt Assessment Update, a proportion of the proposed development arising from
development needs within areas inset within the North Cheshire Green Belt is already channelled to
locations within Cheshire East beyond the outer Green Belt boundary. Directing additional development
to locations beyond the outer Green Belt boundary would lead to unsustainable patterns of development
and would not provide sufficient new development in the areas of need.
8.46 The Green Belt has been a very successful instrument in limiting the expansion of urban areas
and encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land. In addition, many of the settlements
do not have a significant industrial legacy and are not blighted by large areas of derelict industrial
land contributing to a potential supply of appropriately re-usable land for redevelopment. Consequently,
there are not sufficient sites likely to be available to deliver enough market and affordable housing
to meet anywhere near the identified housing needs and not enough opportunities for key additions
to the employment sites portfolio.
8.47 Without alterations to the detailed Green Belt boundaries, the amount of new development
that could be planned for in the north of the borough would be very low. It is considered that such a
low level of development would have severe consequences including:
Demand for new housing outstripping supply, further increasing house prices and a lack of new
affordable housing provision leading to young people and key workers being unable to stay in
the area.
An increasingly ageing population as young people leave and an absolute reduction in the
number of people of working age.
Difficulty in attracting inward investment and economic growth. In areas of relatively unaffordable
housing, employers have difficulty in recruiting to lower paid positions.
Increases in traffic and congestion as people unable to live close to their place of work are forced
to travel longer distances for employment and the smaller working-age population living locally
would also mean more people commuting in to the area.
A decline in the vibrancy and vitality of town centres and some local services and facilities
becoming unviable.

8.49 In the south of the borough, there is a particular need to allow an extension of the Radway
Green employment area in the Green Belt. This is a particularly successful business site which has
diversified from its munitions origins, is short of available space land and is well located near to the
M6 Motorway.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Planning for Growth

8.48 The importance of allocating land to go some way to meeting the identified development needs
in the north of the borough, combined with the consequences for sustainable development of not
doing so, constitutes the exceptional circumstances required to justify alteration of the existing detailed
Green Belt boundaries, whilst maintaining the overall general extent of the Green Belt.

Safeguarded Land
8.50 Green Belt boundaries are intended to endure over the longer-term. Therefore, when reviewing
Green Belt boundaries, it is important to draw the new boundaries having regard to potential
development needs arising well beyond the Plan period.
8.51 Consequently, it is necessary to identify areas of 'safeguarded land' that are between the
urban area and the new Green Belt boundary in order to meet these potential long-term development
requirements and avoid the need for another review of the Green Belt at the end of this plan period.

Policy PG 4
Safeguarded Land
Safeguarded land is land between the existing urban area and the inner boundary of the Green
Belt that may be required to meet longer-term development needs stretching well beyond the
period of the Local Plan.
1.
2.
3.
4.

5.

Safeguarded land is not allocated for development at the present time.
Safeguarded land is outside of the urban area and therefore policies relating to development
in the open countryside will apply.
Any development that would prejudice the future comprehensive development of safeguarded
land will not be permitted.
Development of safeguarded land for uses other than those appropriate in the open
countryside will not be permitted, unless a review of the Local Plan has taken place to
allocate the land following an assessment of the need for development at that time, and
the identification of the most appropriate locations for development to take place.
The areas of safeguarded land are (shown in Figure 8.2):
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.
vii.
viii.

In addition to these areas of safeguarded land listed; it may also be necessary to identify
additional non-strategic areas of land to be safeguarded in the Site Allocations and
Development Policies Document.

8.52 The National Planning Policy Framework requires that, when amending Green Belt boundaries,
Local Planning Authorities should 'where necessary, identify in their plan areas of safeguarded land
between the urban area and the Green Belt, in order to meet longer-term development needs stretching
well beyond the plan period'. They should also 'make clear that the safeguarded land is not allocated
for development at the present time. Planning permission for the permanent development of
safeguarded land should only be granted following a Local Plan review which proposes the
development' as well as 'satisfy themselves that Green Belt boundaries will not need to be altered at
the end of the development plan period''.

Justification

8.53 The development needs beyond this plan period will be determined through future reviews of
the Local Plan. In the absence of guidance on the amount of land that should be safeguarded, a
balanced approach is required that gives confidence on the permanence of the Green Belt boundary
whilst minimising the impact on the Green Belt and making the most efficient use of land.
8.54 Within the South Cheshire Green Belt area, the main settlements of Congleton and Alsager
are located adjacent to, but beyond the Green Belt. There is a significant supply of potential non-Green
Belt land in these areas and therefore no need to designate safeguarded land to ensure permanence
of the South Cheshire Green Belt boundary. Within the North Cheshire Green Belt, the main settlements
are inset within the Green Belt and do not have the same expansion options on non-Green Belt land.
It is therefore necessary to include areas of safeguarded land to make sure that the North Cheshire
Green Belt boundaries will not need to be altered again at the end of the plan period.
8.55 A number of Local Plans have indicated that a 15 year plan period, followed by 5-10 years
worth of safeguarded land will ensure that the Green Belt boundary retains a degree of permanence.
As safeguarded land is only required in the North Cheshire Green Belt, the development requirement
for the northern sub-area in this plan period has been projected forward beyond 2030 to determine
the amount of safeguarded land required.
8.56 Consideration has been given to the likely availability of land beyond 2030. Whilst it is difficult
to identify specific land that may become available so far into the future, there is a range of evidence
to suggest that there will be a continued and reliable source of recycled and other land for development
post 2030. There may also be other further options available to accommodate development including:

Planning for Growth

Channelling development to locations within the inner Green Belt boundary, with the opportunities
arising from the renaissance of our adjacent conurbations;
Channelling development to locations beyond the outer edge of the Green Belt boundary in
Cheshire East. It is anticipated that HS2 will prove decisive in supporting the case for significant
future growth and development in the southern part of the borough, centred around Crewe,
Alsager, Congleton and Middlewich. As evidenced by the volume of sites submitted through the
Local Plan process and Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment, it is clear that there
will continue to be a significant stock of potential development sites in areas beyond the Green
Belt post 2030.

66

8.57 Given the desire to protect the countryside and minimise the impact on the Green Belt, it is
appropriate to provide only the minimum amount of safeguarded land needed to make sure that
Green Belt boundaries do not need to be altered again in the next plan period. Considering the
potential options for accommodating development post 2030, it is considered that there are grounds
for a modest reduction in the timescale for projecting forward needs, to provide for between 8-10
years of safeguarded land. Factors in relation to future housing densities have also been considered,
including an ageing population, increased provision of smaller units and enabling higher densities
through improved urban design. It is considered that there are sufficient grounds for assuming future
housing densities of between 30 and 40 dwellings per hectare. A range of scenarios have been tested
using the parameters on time period for projections and housing densities, which result in a requirement
of between 155 ha and 244 ha of safeguarded land. Overdependence on any single influence is not
appropriate given the timescales and variables involved, and a mid-point of 200 hectares is selected
to take account of all factors concerned.
8.58 At the end of the plan period, the continued supply of recycled and other land for development
as well as the other options to accommodate development and the use of the identified safeguarded
land if required, will be sufficient to ensure that the Green Belt boundary will not need to be reviewed
again at this time.

Strategic Green Gaps
8.59 Maintaining and enhancing the character and separate identities of the borough’s towns and
villages is a key priority of the Local Plan Strategy

Policy PG 5
Strategic Green Gaps
1.

Areas between the following settlements are defined as Strategic Green Gaps:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

2.

3.

These areas are shown on Figure 8.3. The detailed boundaries of the Strategic Green Gaps
will be defined through the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document and shown
on the Adopted Policies Map.
The purposes of Strategic Green Gaps are to:
i.
ii.
iii.

4.

Provide long-term protection against coalescence;
Protect the setting and separate identity of settlements; and
Retain the existing settlement pattern by maintaining the openness of land.

Within Strategic Green Gaps, Policy PG 6 'Open Countryside' will apply. In addition, planning
permission will not be granted for the construction of new buildings or the change of use of
existing buildings of land which would:

Result in erosion of a physical gap between any of the settlements named in this policy;
or
Adversely affect the visual character of the landscape; or
Significantly affect the undeveloped character of the Green Gap, or lead to the
coalescence between existing settlements.

Exceptions to this policy will only be considered where it can be demonstrated that no
suitable alternative location is available.

Planning for Growth

Justification

68

8.60 Within the areas to the south, east and west of Crewe, there are a number of neighbouring
towns and villages in close proximity to each other. As Crewe has grown throughout the 20th Century,
erosion of the gaps between Crewe, Nantwich and a number of smaller settlements has caused
settlements to merge into the urban area in some cases, and very narrow gaps to remain in other
cases.
8.61 The identification of Crewe as a spatial priority for growth brings significant opportunities for
this area, but also some challenges. As Crewe grows to fulfil its potential it will become increasingly
important to maintain the distinctive identity of Nantwich and other nearby settlements and to prevent
them from merging into a Greater Crewe urban area. Accordingly it is not just the narrowest of gaps
that are important – to maintain the sense of separation a broader area of open land is necessary –
including that adjoining smaller settlements.
8.62 As set out in the ‘New Green Belt and Strategic Open Gaps’ study, strong and strategic
long-term policy protection is required to maintain the existing gaps between Crewe and Nantwich,

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

and between Crewe and other settlements that are at risk of coalescence resulting from the future
growth of Crewe.
8.63 The detailed boundaries of the Strategic Green Gaps will be defined through the Site Allocations
and Development Policies Document and shown on the Adopted Policies Map. This will allow for the
full spatial definition of the policy and its delineation to an Ordnance Survey base. Until that time, the
Green Gap boundaries, as defined in the saved Policy NE.4 of the Borough of Crewe and Nantwich
Replacement Local Plan will remain in force, apart from where specific changes are proposed in this
document through the allocation of Local Plan Strategy sites, or where significant development
proposals (10 or more residential units / 1,000 + sq.m. floorspace) adjacent to the urban area have
an uncontested planning permission (or have been completed). The land to north of Moorfields,
Willaston currently has planning permission for residential development (13/3688N) but remains in
the Green Gap pending the outcome of the Supreme Court judgment. The judgment of the Supreme
Court will subsequently be reflected in the detailed boundary of the Strategic Green Gap defined
through the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document and shown on the Adopted Policies
Map.

8.64 The gaps identified in this policy are considered to be the strategic gaps required to prevent
coalescence, primarily arising from the growth of Crewe. The Site Allocations and Development
Policies Document will consider whether there are further, more localised gaps that require additional
policy protection through a Local Green Gaps policy.

where there is the opportunity for limited infilling in villages; the infill of a small gap with
one or two dwellings in an otherwise built up frontage elsewhere; affordable housing,
in accordance with the criteria contained in Policy SC 6 ‘Rural Exceptions Housing for
Local Needs’ or where the dwelling is exceptional in design and sustainable
development terms;
for the re-use of existing rural buildings where the building is permanent, substantial
and would not require extensive alteration, rebuilding or extension
for the replacement of existing buildings (including dwellings) by new buildings not
materially larger than the buildings they replace;
for extensions to existing dwellings where the extension is not disproportionate to the
original dwelling;
for development that is essential for the expansion or redevelopment of an existing
business;
For development that is essential for the conservation and enhancement of a heritage
asset.

The retention of gaps between settlements is important, in order to maintain the definition
and separation of existing communities and the individual characters of such settlements.
The acceptability of such development will be subject to compliance with all other relevant
policies in the Local Plan. In this regard, particular attention should be paid to design and
landscape character so the appearance and distinctiveness of the Cheshire East countryside
is preserved and enhanced.

Planning for Growth

Justification

70

8.66 The Cheshire countryside is highly valued by residents, visitors and businesses alike. From
the sandstone ridge, across the Cheshire Plain and up to the Peak District Fringe, the borough's
countryside is cherished for its scenic, recreational, aesthetic and productive qualities. Much of the
land is fertile and Cheshire East is a vital area for food production. It is the preservation of the
countryside that is the key objective of this policy.

34

Settlement boundaries will be reviewed and defined through the production of the Site Allocations and Development
Policies DPD and neighbourhood plans. Until then, the spatial extent of settlement boundaries are those defined in
the saved policies and proposals maps of the existing local plans for Crewe and Nantwich, Macclesfield and Congleton
and amended to include sites detailed in this Local Plan Strategy, except safeguarded land. Table 8.3 shows settlements
with a boundary defined in the saved policies and proposals maps of the existing local plans and where these are
amended by sites detailed in this Local Plan Strategy.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

8.67
The Open Countryside comprises that part of the Local Plan area outside of identified
settlements. Development in the Open Countryside will normally be unacceptable unless it can be
shown to be essential to local needs and the rural economy and cannot be accommodated within
existing settlements.
8.68 As part of this policy, the gaps between settlements will be protected from inappropriate
development, to make sure that the existing communities retain their separation and definition, along
with their individual character, whilst the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside will be
recognised and protected.

Spatial Distribution
8.72 The overall level of development between 2010 and 2030 is set out in Policy PG 1 'Overall
Development Strategy'. Given the diverse nature of settlements in Cheshire East, each with different
needs and constraints, it is appropriate to set indicative levels of development by settlement.
8.73 These figures are intended as a guide and are neither a ceiling nor a target. In addition to
completions since 2010 and current commitments (e.g. planning permissions), provision will be made
(35)
to allocate sufficient new sites
in each area to facilitate the levels of development set out in this
policy.

Through Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations in this document and further non-strategic sites in the Site
Allocations and Development Policies Document

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

8.75 The distribution also takes into account the core planning principles set out in the National
Planning Policy Framework, which states that planning should take account of the varied roles and
character of different areas, and actively manage patterns of growth to make the fullest possible use
of public transport, walking and cycling and focus significant development in locations that are or can
be made sustainable.
8.76 Settlement boundaries for each of the settlements in Policy PG 7 are as defined in the saved
policies of the Borough of Crewe and Nantwich Replacement Local Plan, Congleton Borough Local
Plan First Review and the Macclesfield Borough Local Plan, and are as amended by the sites detailed
in this Local Plan Strategy document. Further amendments to settlement boundaries will be undertaken
through the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document.
8.77 Cheshire East is a high quality place to live and work. The Local Plan Strategy seeks to
manage change over the plan period to make sure that it reinforces the advantages the area already
possesses, in a sustainable way. Table 8.4 presents an indicative distribution for the levels of the
settlement hierarchy in the borough. The figure for Local Service Centres will be further disaggregated
in the Site Allocations and Development Policies DPD and / or Neighbourhood Plans.

8.78 Appendix A provides further detail about the distribution of development in Cheshire East. It
should be noted that the actual levels of employment land and housing development shown in Policy
PG 7 are below the numbers proposed in the Spatial Distribution of Development Policy. This is to
provide flexibility and to allow for a proportion of slippage, such as developments occurring after the
plan period, or for sites coming forward at lower densities than currently expected.
8.79 The Housing Development Study suggests that, on the basis of migration, travel to work and
other data, Cheshire East is an appropriate geography for planning purposes over which to assess
and meet housing requirements and comprises two functional housing sub-market areas: one is
focused on the former Macclesfield district and exhibits strong interactions with Greater Manchester
market; the second is focused on the former Crewe & Nantwich district and Congleton districts, and
has noticeable market interactions with North Staffordshire and Greater Manchester.
8.80 The council recognises the importance of Green Belt in the borough in terms of its function
and the original reasons for its allocation. The Green Belt in the north of the Borough is drawn tightly
around existing settlements. Additionally, the north of the borough is under pressure from development
spreading out from the Greater Manchester conurbation. Despite this there remains an identified
need in the north of the borough for both market and affordable housing to meet the Macclesfield
functional housing market area and also to deliver employment land in the borough. The Local Plan
Strategy therefore has allocated a small number of sites concentrated in particular areas to minimise
the impact on the Green Belt.
8.81 The approach of the Local Plan Strategy has been to focus development in the Principal
Towns of Crewe and Macclesfield, delivering the aspirations set out in 'All Change for Crewe' and
meeting the housing market and employment requirements of Macclesfield, whilst limiting the impact
on the Green Belt.
8.82 It is also appropriate to direct a significant proportion of development to the remaining
higher-order centres (the Key Service Centres), which provide a good range of services and
opportunities for employment, retail and education alongside good public transport links. New
development in the Key Service Centres will help to sustain services and facilities in these settlements
and assist in improving the vitality and viability of their retail centres against a backdrop of an ageing
population and increased competition from out-of-town and online retailing. In the Key Service
Centres, an appropriate level of new employment provision is planned, in order to allow for employment
growth to meet local needs and reduce the need to travel.

Planning for Growth

8.83 Outside of the Green Belt areas, substantial development in the Key Service Centres recognises
the role of these towns in the provision of essential services. For Key Service Centres surrounded
by Green Belt, the scale of development proposed is limited so that the fundamental objectives of
the Green Belt are not compromised whilst meeting an appropriate proportion of locally-arising needs.
This is essential to provide new affordable housing and new jobs and to sustain services and facilities
in the settlements.

78

8.84 The focus of development around Key Service Centres that are not surrounded by Green Belt
has been to encourage future inward investment and sustain the vitality and vibrancy of those towns.
Development in towns such as Congleton will result in additional investment, both in infrastructure
and services, including the delivery of the Congleton Link Road, which will provide for additional land
for development and investment into the town.
8.85

The North Cheshire Growth Village at Handforth East will:
Provide access to services and employment opportunities located in Manchester
Provide access to services and facilities in Handforth
Effectively meet a significant proportion of the needs of the northern Green Belt towns, due to
its closeness to a number of settlements
Provide the funding to support the delivery of infrastructure improvements required to support
the economic growth of Cheshire East
Reduce the impact of the release of Green Belt on existing communities

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Allow the council to reflect the opinions of the local communities within the north of the borough
who wish to see the general extent of the Green Belt around existing settlements to be maintained
Maximise opportunities for beneficial development, due to the limited number of physical
constraints to the site

9 Planning for Sustainable Development
9.1 Cheshire East has the exciting opportunity to deliver successful sustainable development and
support the growth of vibrant sustainable communities through the growth envisaged within the
borough. The concept of sustainability is an extremely complicated one with many interwoven factors
needing to be addressed to ensure a successful approach. The UK Sustainable Development Strategy
Securing the Future sets out five guiding principles of sustainable development: living within the
planet's environmental limits; ensuring a strong, healthy and just society; achieving a sustainable
economy; promoting good governance; and using sound science responsibly.

Policy SD 1
Sustainable Development in Cheshire East
In order to achieve sustainable development in Cheshire East, the following considerations to
development will apply. Development should wherever possible:

Contribute to creating a strong, responsive and competitive economy for Cheshire East;
Prioritise investment and growth within the Principal Towns and Key Service Centres;
Contribute to the creation of sustainable communities;
Provide appropriate infrastructure to meet the needs of the local community including:
education; health and social care; transport; communication technology; landscaping and
open space; sport and leisure; community facilities; water; waste water; and energy;
Provide access to local jobs, services and facilities, reflecting the community's needs;
Ensure that development is accessible by public transport, walking and cycling;
Provide safe access and sufficient car parking in accordance with adopted highway
standards;
Support the health, safety, social and cultural well-being of the residents of Cheshire East;
Provide a locally distinct, high quality, sustainable, well designed and durable environment;
Contribute towards the achievement of equality and social inclusion through positive
cooperation with the local community;
Use appropriate technologies to reduce carbon emissions and create a low carbon economy;
Incorporate sustainable design and construction methods;
Support the achievement of vibrant and prosperous town and village centres;
Contribute to protecting and enhancing the natural, built, historic and cultural environment;
Make efficient use of land, protect the best and most versatile agricultural land and make
best use of previously developed land where possible;
Encourage the reuse of existing buildings; and
Prioritise the most accessible and sustainable locations.

Justification
9.2 The National Planning Policy Framework definition of sustainable development is: “meeting
the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs". The Framework outlines an approach to sustainable development which seeks to foster
positive growth leading to economic, environmental and social progress whilst finding the means to
accommodate new ways by which we will earn our living in a competitive world. The Framework
establishes the need to balance these aims and provide for the needs of a rising, longer living
population, whilst responding to the changes that new technologies offer us and ensuring that our
lives, and the places in which we live them, can change for the better.
9.3 Whilst the Local Plan Strategy includes the presumption in favour of sustainable development
as a 'golden thread' running through the strategy, Policy SD 1 seeks to further define the considerations

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

used at a local level in order to achieve sustainable development in Cheshire East in line with achieving
the vision and strategic priorities set out in the Local Plan Strategy.

Planning for Sustainable Development

Justification

84

9.4 Planning, through the Local Plan Strategy, has a key role in addressing the impacts of climate
change in terms of both mitigation and adaptation. The Local Plan Strategy sets out a minimum
requirement of 36,000 new homes and the accommodation of a minimum of 380 hectares of
employment land by 2030, which could considerably raise the amount of carbon emissions and impact
on the wider environment unless adequate measures are introduced to combat this. Directing
development to the most sustainable locations and thus improving accessibility and reducing the
need to travel through the spatial strategy will have a significant impact on climate change at the local
level. However, individual development proposals must themselves also play a key role in mitigating
the causes and adapting to the effects of climate change.
9.5 Table 9.1 provides a guide to the appropriate distances for access to services and amenities.
A methodology for the assessment of walking distances has been informed by that of the North West
Sustainability Checklist (now revoked), which has been backed by the Department for Communities
and Local Government (DCLG) and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). These distances are actual
distances using public highways and footpaths. The distances are considered appropriate for the
region and have been used for the purposes of informing the Sustainability Appraisal and the
accessibility of proposed developments.
9.6 In assessing the distances to services and amenities, consideration will also be given to the
quality of the pedestrian, cycle or other transportation routes.

37
38

As a guide, a range is considered to be within the maximum recommended distance of a bus stop; a multi-functional
open space; and a convenience store, in addition to four or more other services or amenities, dependent on location.
Recommended distances are set out in Table 9.1 below. The council will have regard to proposed improvements to
services and amenities that are to be brought forward as part of the development.

10 Infrastructure
10.1 Sufficient appropriate infrastructure is crucial to the well-being of any society. From the roads,
railways and cycle paths that cross the borough to schools, health care facilities and the pipes below
ground that provide us with water, gas and telecommunications, a fully operational, well-planned,
well connected and well-maintained infrastructure has to be at the heart of good planning, now and
into the future. Infrastructure is also essential for economic development, to underpin the jobs-led
growth strategy.
10.2 The timely provision of infrastructure is associated with the need which arises directly as a
consequence of that development. It is important to ensure that development is adequately supported
by appropriate infrastructure, whether using existing or through new provision. Delivering or improving
infrastructure on time is therefore extremely important in ensuring that roads, local services and
facilities can cope with added demand.

Policy IN 1
Infrastructure
1.

2.

3.

Infrastructure delivery will take place in a phased co-ordinated manner guided by the
Infrastructure Delivery Plan and any additional site specific requirements to support the
Local Plan Strategy proposals. These will include mechanisms for the funding and delivery
of physical, social, community, environmental and any other infrastructure required to support
development and regeneration. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan will be kept under review
and if necessary revised as and when required. Cheshire East Council is working in
partnership with infrastructure providers and other delivery agencies to provide essential
infrastructure to deliver the Local Plan.
The council will also require new and improved social and community facilities, utilities
infrastructure and other infrastructure to be provided in a timely manner to meet the needs
of new development as they arise so as to make a positive contribution towards safeguarding
and creating sustainable communities, promote social inclusion and reduce deprivation.
The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), upon adoption of the Charging Schedule, will be
used to pool developer contributions towards local and strategic infrastructure that will serve
a wider area than any one development in particular. Further information is set out in Policy
IN 2 'Developer Contributions'.

Justification
10.3 The term 'infrastructure' is broadly used for planning purposes to cover all the service
requirements that are needed to make places function efficiently and effectively and in a way that
creates sustainable communities. Infrastructure is commonly split into three main categories, defined
as:

Infrastructure

1.

88

Physical: the broad collection of systems and facilities that house and transport people and
goods, and provide services including:
Transportation networks - including public transport, road networks, provisions for walking
and cycling;
Water - including wastewater treatment and water supply, including fire hydrants;
Flood risk management;
Energy - including heat, gas, electricity;
Telecommunications networks - telephones, mobile phones, broadband and other new
communication technologies;

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Waste provision - including domestic waste and recycling, commercial and construction
waste;
Public realm - street lighting, seating, planting.
2.

Green: the physical environment within and between our cities, towns and villages. A network
of multi-functional open spaces including formal parks, gardens, woodlands, green corridors,
waterways and open countryside.

3.

Social and Community: the range of core learning, well-being, sports and other activities. It can
include the provision of:
Health facilities - including hospitals, doctors and dentists surgeries;
Social care;
Education - including schools, colleges and skills training
Social and community facilities - including places of worship, community centres, support
for community groups and projects;
Leisure facilities - indoor and outdoor, including sports pitches and changing facilities;
Cultural facilities - including libraries, museums, theatres and heritage.

10.4 Improvements to infrastructure will be fundamental to achieving the vision for the development
of Cheshire East up to 2030 and are necessary to deal with existing deficiencies and to cater for a
growing and ageing population. The proposed growth of Cheshire East must be supported by
improvements to physical, social and green infrastructure.
10.5 Improved connectivity forms a vital part of the Local Plan Strategy in terms of assisting economic
growth and improving the environment. As well as maximising the benefits of Crewe as a national
rail hub, substantial new road infrastructure will be required to open up the east of Cheshire and
better connect the M6 with main settlements and surrounding major roads. At this stage, only corridors
of interest or preferred routes for new roads are indicated. Detailed alignments will be included in the
Site Allocations and Development Policies Document.
10.6 It should be recognised that the delivery of the full range of infrastructure needs of existing
and new communities is dependent on partnership working between a variety of public and private
sector agencies. Throughout the preparation of the Local Plan Strategy, discussions have taken place
with key infrastructure delivery partners and will continue to take place through the production of the
Local Plan.
10.7 Where new development creates a need for new or improved infrastructure, contributions
from developers will be sought to make the development acceptable on the impact on local services.
10.8 The infrastructure requirements of development proposals will be assessed on their own
individual merits; but in some circumstances there will be a necessity to view individual applications
collectively in assessing the combined off site requirements in line with the Infrastructure Delivery
Plan.

10.10 The council intends to locally introduce the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) approach
to Developer Contributions. The Levy will partly replace Section 106 provisions and is a charge based
on the floor area of new developments. The charge rates will be set out in a Charging Schedule which
will be implemented after the adoption of the Local Plan Strategy.

Infrastructure

10.9 Strategic infrastructure requirements are set out in the Local Plan Strategy and in the
Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Whilst particular infrastructure needs have been identified, it is recognised
that there needs to be flexibility to allow the council to seek developer contributions through Section
106 agreements and other mechanisms for infrastructure needs that emerge during the plan period.

89

Policy IN 2
Developer Contributions
1.

2.

Developer contributions will be sought to make sure that the necessary physical, social,
public realm, economic and green infrastructure is in place to deliver development.
Contributions will be used to mitigate the adverse impacts of development (including any
cumulative impact). Such contributions will help facilitate the infrastructure needed to support
sustainable development.
Development proposals will be expected to provide a contribution towards the cost of
infrastructure. Subject to statutory processes and regulations, contributions may be collected
towards:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.

Initial costs, e.g. design and development work and pump priming of projects or
programmes;
Capital costs;
Ongoing revenue such as the management and maintenance of services and facilities;
Any other infrastructure related costs permitted by law and identified as a local need;
Contributions will be collected through Section 106 agreements and / or through a
Community Infrastructure Levy once a Charging Schedule is in place; and
Until a Charging Schedule is in place, contributions from Section 106 agreements may
be pooled to meet the costs of strategic infrastructure, where this meets the legal tests
as set out in the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations. Once the Charging
Schedule is in place, Section 106 agreements will continue to be used for site specific
costs and affordable housing.

Justification
10.11 Any Section 106 planning obligations can only be taken into account in determining planning
applications where they meet the following tests from Regulation 122 of the CIL Regulations 2010:
Necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms;
Directly related to the development; and
Fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.
10.12 Developer contributions secured through planning obligations are no longer able to be pooled
from more than five different obligations to deliver the provision of a certain project or type of
infrastructure. This restriction, from Regulation 123 of the CIL Regulations 2010, is intended to ensure
that local planning authorities use CIL instead of planning obligations to secure contributions for
infrastructure that serves a wider area than just the specific development site or group of sites.

Infrastructure

10.13 The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), upon adoption of the Charging Schedule, will be
used to pool developer contributions towards local and strategic infrastructure that will serve a wider
area than any one development in particular.

90

10.14 The CIL is a locally set standard charge that can be applied to new development to fund
infrastructure. It is calculated in £ per sq m of new buildings or extensions and is based on the fact
that the value of land or property typically rises as a result of development. Whilst the charge can be
varied by area and type of development on the basis of viability evidence, there are no other reasons
for setting differential CIL charges.
10.15 Cheshire East Council have identified, in an Infrastructure Delivery Plan, what strategic
infrastructure is needed to support the amount and distribution of growth proposed in the Local Plan
Strategy, and how much it will cost, including the funding shortfall identified after taking account of
already committed funding. Before developer contributions can be sought through CIL to make up at

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

least part of this shortfall, a Levy Charging Schedule will be published, consulted on, examined and
adopted, establishing a Levy Charge.
10.16 CIL may be used to fund the provision, improvement, replacement, operation or maintenance
of infrastructure that arises as a result of increased development related demand. The following types

greater understanding of the infrastructure requirements for Cheshire East.
10.19 The government has stated that parish councils can receive 15% of CIL payments, capped
at £100 per dwelling. This is raised to an uncapped 25% where the parish council has a Neighbourhood
Plan. The money is paid directly to the parish council, to be spent on community infrastructure projects
of their choosing.

11 Enterprise and Growth
11.1 The Cheshire East economy is already the most successful in the North of England. This
Local Plan Strategy will ensure the right foundations are in place to sustain this success over the
next twenty years.
11.2 The vision for economic growth is encapsulated with the vision of ‘East Cheshire, Engine of
the North’. This strategic framework builds on the existing asset base and sets out a growth plan over
the plan period.
11.3 The vision for economic growth captures two concepts which represent the diversity and
strength of the borough:
Crewe High Growth City/M6 Corridor – a growth proposition for the south of the borough
centred around Crewe as a Principal Town but linking to a wider set of growth ‘nodes’
using the M6 Corridor as a key attractor and asset to support our ambition.
North Cheshire Science Corridor - to secure North East Cheshire as a location of national
and global significance for advanced scientific analysis and research, particularly
pharmaceuticals R&D, pharmaceuticals manufacturing, radio-astrophysics and astronomy.

Crewe: High Growth City
11.4 As the largest town in South Cheshire, Crewe is already the area’s primary population centre
and its major economic hub. Its 5,000 businesses include concentrations of professional services,
distribution, logistics and advanced engineering built on its rich rail and automotive heritage. It is
located in not only one of the most prosperous parts of the region but the best connected, creating
the perfect location for job creation, growth and development.
11.5 The jobs-led vision encapsulated by this Local Plan Strategy provides the opportunity for
decentralisation of the economy outside of London and the South East, creating a ‘hub’ of investment
in science, automotive and rail engineering. The recent £1 billion investment announced by Bentley
Motors secures Crewe’s place as a premier location for excellence in manufacturing and engineering.
11.6 Linked by the M6 Growth Corridor, expansion of employment land in Congleton will lead to
future investment in the bedrock of manufacturing and engineering which is key to the town’s heritage
and future prosperity. Major investment in infrastructure in Congleton via a new link road is also
proposed alongside the expansion of employment space and new housing development.

11.7 North East Cheshire, as part of a wider North West Science & Technology cluster, has the
potential to become a UK lead specifically to aid commercialisation of innovation in the ‘Key
(39)
(40)
Enabling’ , 'Great Eight'
and ‘Health-Science’ technology fields. The area is host to a net
concentration of globally significant companies which represent a hotbed of intellectual capacity and
entrepreneurship. Cheshire East has particularly high levels of R&D activities within Great Britain,
with Cheshire East accounting for 36.9% of the region’s R&D jobs and 3.3% of the country’s (GB)
(41)
R&D jobs.

11.8 This success is founded on an outstanding track record of creating and building new businesses
and attracting investment in a high quality environment with the advantage of global connectivity,
both physical and digital. The focus of the council and this Local Plan Strategy will be to nurture and
strengthen our science and technology base to create a Super-Hub of global companies and a growing
base of SMEs for north Cheshire. Our vision is that by 2030, the North East Cheshire Science Corridor
will sit clearly within a flourishing science and technology ecosystem spanning across Cheshire and
Warrington.
11.9 There will be a Super-Hub of global companies and a growing base of SMEs delivering a
dynamic model of open innovation and growth from high quality and well connected locations.
11.10 With globally significant companies working alongside world-leading research institutions,
there will be an established network of innovation in science and technology, underpinned by
revolutionary and innovative finance tools to promote a growing base of enterprising and high growth
SMEs.
11.11 At the heart of this hotbed of science and technology will be a continually high-skilled and
entrepreneurial workforce, nurtured through a network of leading research institutions and specialised
education facilities.
11.12 The Local Plan Strategy provides a vital tool to interpret our wider vision into a spatial planning
framework, which will be complemented by a wider investment strategy and delivery plan for the
borough.
11.13

The Local Plan Strategy will support delivery of the Economic Growth vision by:

Providing the right sites in the right locations with the right infrastructure, enhanced by the highest
quality of life – to attract the best talent.
Increasing the supply of business incubation, including premises and targeted business support
– making best use of existing employment sites and brownfield development in town centres.
Maximising the potential of major employment sites such as Alderley Park and Hurdsfield to
create the conditions for open innovation and science-led collaborations.
Ensure a housing offer of the highest quality providing a major incentive for a highly qualified
workforce to live and locate in the area.
Create stronger public transport and wider connectivity linked to Manchester Airport, the M6
corridor and the Manchester conurbation.
Protect and improve the quality of the environment, to provide the wider quality of life factors
required.

Enterprise and Growth

11.14 Across the borough there is a need for sustainable, jobs led growth, in conjunction with
planning ahead to 2030 and beyond; additional opportunities for growth will be assessed as they
arise. It is anticipated that the majority of future employment growth opportunities will be to the south
of the borough, with the north exhibiting distinct trends in science and service sector growth. As a
result, we do not support high levels of housing growth to the north of the borough.

Economic Prosperity
11.15 Cheshire East's economy is characterised by a broad range of industries and services, with
particular strengths in pharmaceuticals, financial businesses and advanced engineering, whilst the
rural nature of the borough is reflected in the relatively high number of people employed in agriculture
and tourism.

Policy EG 1
Economic Prosperity
1.

Proposals for employment development (Use Classes B1, B2 or B8) will be supported in
principle within the Principal Towns, Key Service Centres and Local Service Centres as
well as on employment land allocated in the Development Plan.

2.

Proposals for employment development on non-allocated employment sites will be supported
where they are in the right location and support the strategy, role and function of the town,
as identified in Settlement Hierarchy, Spatial Distribution of Development and in any future
plans, including Neighbourhood Plans, where applicable.

Justification
11.16 The National Planning Policy Framework states that "to help achieve economic growth, local
planning authorities should plan proactively to meet the development needs of business and support
st
an economy fit for the 21 Century".
11.17 Cheshire East's employment policy seeks to encourage growth in the borough and secure
a greater number of jobs for its resident workforce. The Cheshire East Local Plan will be focused on
delivering growth, including ensuring that there is an appropriate balance between jobs, services and
facilities and homes, creating a more sustainable pattern of development in the borough.
11.18 Policy EG 1 supports the delivery of opportunities for the provision of employment land that
may come forward in the Principal Towns, Key Service Centres and Local Service Centres, in addition
to the employment land that is allocated in the Local Plan Strategy. This policy will contribute to the
achievement of the strategic objective to promote economic prosperity by creating conditions for
business growth. The potential for employment growth in the visitor economy is dealt with in Policy
EG 4 'Tourism'.

Justification

11.20 The rural economy provides a wide range of important goods and services, including clean
water, biodiversity, recreational space and opportunities, food energy and carbon management. Rural
land is a vital resource for mitigating and adapting to the various challenges of climate change, such
as drought and flooding. The countryside is also home to settlements and communities, where
economic activities include agriculture and other farm based industries, as well as businesses
associated with countryside pursuits, including rural tourism and leisure. Beyond farming, the rural
economy in Cheshire East supports many businesses, including wholesale and retail trade, repairs,
manufacturing, health and social work, horse-related enterprises (breeding, training and livery) and
real estate, renting and business activities.

11.19 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'planning policies should support
economic growth in rural areas in order to create jobs and prosperity by taking a positive approach
to sustainable new development'.

11.21 Planning has a key role to play in ensuring that the rural economy is viable, meets the needs
of existing residents of rural areas and that growth and development is appropriate to the scale of
each area and that it has a positive impact upon biodiversity, geodiversity, the landscape and the
historic environment.

The site is no longer suitable or viable for employment use; and
a.
b.

set out in Policies MP 1, SD 1 and SD 2 of the Local Plan Strategy. All opportunities must
be explored to incorporate an element of employment development as part of a mixed use
scheme.
Subject to regular review, allocated employment sites will be protected for employment use
in order to maintain an adequate and flexible supply of employment land to attract new and
innovative businesses, to enable existing businesses to grow and to create new and retain
existing jobs.

Justification

Enterprise and Growth

11.22 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'policies should avoid the long term
protection of sites allocated for employment use where there is no reasonable prospect of a site being
used for that purpose'.

98

11.23 In order to provide a range of employment sites, particularly for inward investment and limit
the need for development on greenfield land, it is vital that existing employment sites, premises and
allocations that are viable for continued employment use are safeguarded. This will make sure that
job opportunities are maintained and the economic health of the borough is protected. The release
of viable employment sites or premises to other uses may only be made where their loss would not
cause harm to business or employment opportunities, or where there are unacceptable amenity
impacts for local residents.
11.24 For clarification, this policy applies to all sites currently in use for employment purposes (B1,
B2 and B8 uses in the Use Classes Order) as well as sites allocated for such uses.
11.25 There are already a number of key employment areas in the borough, including Alderley
Park, Hurdsfield Industrial Estate, Bentley Motors, Radbroke Hall, Jodrell Bank, Booths Hall and
43

To demonstrate that no other occupiers can be found, the site should be marketed at a realistic price reflecting its
employment status for a period of not less than 2 years. The council will require evidence that a proper marketing
exercise has been carried out including a record of all offers and expressions of interest received.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Alderley Park - Currently AstraZeneca’s largest research facility and the company’s global
centre for cancer research. A development framework has been developed. The objective of
this document is to maximise the employment potential of the site to deliver a life science vision,
and also to look at wider uses for all aspects of the site, which would meet community/local
need.
Hurdsfield Industrial Estate, Macclesfield - As the largest traditional industrial estate in
Cheshire East, it is home to a number of major multinational companies, including AstraZeneca
and BASF Performance Products Ltd. This industrial estate accommodates an important
concentration of activity. Work is ongoing to maximise the employment uses and land uses on
the Hurdsfield Estate, to ensure it plays its role in delivering our economic vision for the borough
and create growth opportunities for local and new companies seeking to locate in North Cheshire.
Bentley Motors, Crewe - This is the town's largest private sector employer, currently employing
3,500 people. As the company’s UK headquarters, the site is home to all aspects of car production
from design, engineering, manufacturing, quality, and sales and marketing. Following an
announcement in July 2013 of an £800m investment by the company to manufacture its new
Sport Utility Vehicle, plans for significant growth at the site are expected alongside the creation
(44)
of 1,000 new jobs. With advanced manufacturing accounting for 12.3%
of employment in
Cheshire East, the Bentley site is at the centre of this growing sector, and is responsible for a
growing supply chain in the nearby area.
Radbroke Hall, Knutsford - The site currently accommodates the UK Strategic Centre for
Barclays Bank Plc and is home to the Global Infrastructure and Service Delivery Teams. The
site is at the forefront of a growing IT and financial / insurance service industry, of which Cheshire
East has a higher concentration than in the North West region as a whole.
Jodrell Bank, Holmes Chapel - prominently located in the heart of Cheshire East this is a
unique site, which is of both historical and scientific significance as a leading facility for radio
astrophysics and scientific research in the UK. The Discovery Centre also offers an important
contribution to the Cheshire East visitor economy. The site is also on the UK National Shortlist
for UNESCO in a bid for World Heritage Status due to its potential outstanding universal value.
Booths Hall, Knutsford - Booths Hall combines an 85 hectare parkland setting with flexible,
high quality office accommodation, which is home to a growing number of small high growth,
high tech companies and major multinationals. The site offers a quality employment location in
the heart of Cheshire, with good links into public transport and road/rail links. The park is a major
contributor to Knutsford and the wider regional economy with many leading international and
knowledge-based businesses located there. 80% of the existing occupiers operate in Cheshire
East's growth sectors.
Midpoint 18, Middlewich - This is a mixed use business park currently home to major companies
such as Wincanton and Kuehne + Nagel. The current development footprint provides 128,130
square metres of mixed employment use, including office, distribution, and manufacturing space.
Crewe Green Business Park, Crewe - This is the largest business park in Crewe; it is over 27
hectares and accommodates employers such as Air Products, Busch GVT, Wulvern Housing
and DEFRA. Crewe Green Business Park, and Crewe Gates and Weston Road industrial areas
are adjacent to each other and form together a diverse, influential and important area of economic
activity.
Crewe Gates Industrial Estate, Crewe - The largest industrial area within the largest town in
Cheshire East. Employers located here include Expert Logistics, JTI UK, 20:20 Mobile and
Bargain Booze Headquarters.
Waters Corporation, Wilmslow - Waters Corporation have recently completed the construction
of a mass spectrometry headquarters located at the 15 hectare Stamford Lodge site. This facility

Midpoint 18. These are of particular significance to the economy in Cheshire East, collectively
employing over 13,000 personnel. The following provides an overview of their contribution to the
borough's strong economic base together with additional key sites that form part of the borough's
employment land portfolio:

99

will provide employment to over 500 employees committed to the support and development of
mass spectrometry systems. Waters is a world leader in this field of scientific innovation.
Sanofi Aventis, Holmes Chapel - Sanofi is a global integrated healthcare leader in the
pharmaceutical industry. The site, prominently located on the edge of Holmes Chapel, is a centre
of excellence for the manufacture of inhalation products for the worldwide market.
11.26 Whilst the Local Plan Strategy seeks to retain these key employment areas, it also provides
opportunities for further inward investment at other established locations such as Radway Green,
Congleton Business Park, Radnor Park Trading Estate and others. The Local Plan Strategy also
seeks to unlock major new employment sites including Basford East and West and other developments
to meet both latent demand and future projected growth. A range of employment sites are allocated
around Crewe and in the south of the borough to facilitate economic growth and deliver the aspirations
set out by 'All Change for Crewe: High Growth City'.

Tourism

Enterprise and Growth

11.27 Nationally, tourism generates £90 billion of direct spending, provides 1.36 million jobs and
is the fifth or sixth biggest sector of the UK economy in most years. The visitor economy is an important
contributor to businesses and communities in Cheshire East, bringing 13.2 million visitors to the
borough each year, generating around £700m a year for the local economy and employing about
10,000 people, with food and drink, accommodation and shopping accounting for most of these jobs
(45)
. The rich and varied natural and historic environment, and the beauty and character of the wider
countryside, plays a vital role in the visitor economy of Cheshire East. These borough-wide assets
will be protected and where possible, enhanced to help drive the visitor economy as well as for their
own sake. As part of the plan for growth it is important that the visitor economy is able to maximise
its contribution to the economy, employment and quality of life of Cheshire East.

The protection of Cheshire East's tourist assets, such as Tatton Park, Quarry Bank
Mill, Little Moreton Hall, Macclesfield Silk Museum, Jodrell Bank, the Peak District
National Park (adjoining the plan area), Alderley Edge, the Gritstone Trail, Tegg’s Nose
Country Park, Sandstone Ridge and the waterways that support appropriate sustainable
tourist related development;
Protecting visitor attraction sites;
Promoting the enhancement and expansion of existing visitor attractions and tourist
accommodation, and the provision of new visitor and tourism facilities, in sustainable
and appropriate locations;
Encouraging sustainable transport to tourist and cultural sites;
Encouraging and promoting opportunities for new tourist attractions in the historic and
natural environment in sustainable and appropriate locations; and
Improving access to our natural and historic landscapes through enhancing our vital
public rights of way network

Proposals for tourist development of an appropriate scale, including attractions and tourist
accommodation, will be supported within the Principal Towns and Key Service Centres.
Proposals for tourist development outside the Principal Towns and Key Service Centres
will be supported where:
i.

Either:
a.
b.
c.

ii.

They are located within a Local Service Centre; or
They are located within an existing or replacement building; or
There is evidence that the facilities are required in conjunction with a particular

And:
a.

b.
c.
d.

The scale, design and use of the proposal is compatible with its wider landscape
or townscape setting and would not detract from the character or appearance of
the area; and
It would not be detrimental to the amenities of residential areas; and
The proposals are served by adequate access and infrastructure; and
The site has access to local services and employment.

Justification
11.28 The National Planning Policy Framework states that Local Plans should 'support sustainable
rural tourism and leisure developments that benefit businesses in rural areas, communities and
visitors, and which respect the character of the countryside'.
11.29 The National Planning Policy Framework supports this agenda through a range of policy
directives to support:
Sustainable rural tourism;

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

1.

101

Competitive town centres;
Sustainable transport;
High quality design;
Inclusive communities;
Enhancement of the natural environment; and
Enjoyment of the historic environment.
11.30 Together these policies underpin the Cheshire East approach to sustainable tourism and
our ambition is to maximise its contribution to the economy, employment and quality of life in Cheshire
East.
11.31 The visitor economy covers a wide range of activities across a variety of themes and locations
in Cheshire East. Attractions such as Tatton Park, Jodrell Bank and Little Moreton Hall may be
considered visitor destinations in their own right; leisure based visits might cross the borough over a
variety of canal, cycle or public footpath networks; and culture and recreational activities may take
visitors to parks and gardens, market towns, and festivals across the borough.
11.32 Visits to and within the borough generate economic activity and support jobs and industries.
By maintaining and improving infrastructure associated with the visitor economy, including green
infrastructure and improvements to the rights of way network, communities are better able to access
active leisure opportunities and participate in the cultural and social life of the borough.
11.33 Enabling residents and visitors to access, understand and engage with the heritage, landscape
and cultural assets of the borough promotes a sense of place and pride in communities that alongside
an attractive cultural, recreational and leisure offer, can be effective in attracting highly skilled
individuals and businesses to locate in the area and may contribute to long term prosperity,
regeneration and support for services.
11.34 Whilst it is important to support our visitor economy, it is also important to protect those
assets that make the borough attractive to visitors including landscape, public realm and heritage. In
particular, it is important to minimise the impact generated by tourism travel.
11.35 Planning has a key role to play in enabling and encouraging more of our 10.3 million day
visitors to stay longer and spend more by:
supporting the industry to increase the number of overnight stays;
promoting good design in the built environment and public space;
protecting the quality of natural and historic landscapes;
improving the provision of arts and heritage; and
enhancing the visitor experience through improvements to the public realm.

Town Centres
11.36 The council advocates a clear 'town centre first' approach for its Principal Towns and Key
Service Centres. It is fully supportive of the government's aims to promote the vitality and viability of
town and other centres as important places for communities. They are a major focus for employment
and drivers of economic growth.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

11.37 Cheshire East is a borough with a significant number of towns and villages, each with its
own distinct identity and character and offering an individual experience. They are key drivers in
Cheshire East's economic prosperity and the focus will be on the continued development of the
centres as commercial, retail, visitor and leisure hubs.

i.

ii.

iii.

iv.

2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

7.

The Principal Towns will be the main focus for high quality comparison retail, supported
by a range of retail, service, leisure, tourism, office and other town centre-type uses,
including residential.
In the Key Service Centres, there will be a focus on the improvement of the convenience
and comparison retail offer, with the potential to strengthen and enhance the retail
offer, where suitable, as well as diversification to other uses such as offices, services,
leisure, cultural and residential, as appropriate.
In the Local Service Centres, there will be a focus on convenience and comparison
retailing of an appropriate scale, plus opportunities for service uses and small-scale
independent retailing of a function and character that meets the needs of the local
community.
In the other settlements and rural areas of the borough, there will be a focus on
providing retail and services of appropriate scale and nature to meet the needs of the
local community.

Town centres will be promoted as the primary location for main town centre uses including
retail, leisure, cultural and office development.
The use of upper floors in town and other centres for non-retail uses will be supported,
where appropriate.
The retention and enhancement of the borough's markets will be encouraged.
Small parades of shops will be protected where they are important to the day-to-day needs
of local communities.
Proposals that help develop the evening and night-time economy in the Principal Towns
and Key Service Centres will be supported, where any negative impacts on amenity are
addressed.
Proposals for main town centre uses should be located within the designated town centres
or on other sites allocated for that particular type of development. Where there are no
suitable sites available, edge-of-centre locations must be considered prior to out-of centre
locations. Edge-of-centre and out-of-centre proposals will be considered where:
i.
ii.
iii.

there is no significant adverse impact on the vitality and viability of the surrounding
town centres; and
it is demonstrated that the tests outlined in current government guidance can be
satisfied.
The sequential approach will not be applied to applications for small scale rural offices
or other small scale rural development in line with the government guidance.

Justification
11.38 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'planning policies should be positive,
promote competitive town centre environments and set out policies for the management and growth
of centres over the plan period'. It goes on to state that 'local planning authorities should:

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Enterprise and Growth

1.

103

recognise town centres as the heart of their communities and pursue policies to support their
viability and vitality;
define a network and hierarchy of centres that is resilient to anticipated future economic changes;
promote competitive town centres that provide customer choice and a diverse retail offer and
which reflect the individuality of town centres;
set policies for the consideration of proposals for main town centre uses which cannot be
accommodated in or adjacent to town centres'.
11.39 It is important to determine appropriate policies for retailing, focused on town centres, as
they are often a central part of community identity and contain the shops, services, pubs, restaurants,
leisure, entertainment and other facilities that people wish to access locally, as well as businesses,
employment and homes. Town centres are generally accessible by a wide range of transport modes
and provide the greatest opportunity for linked trips. Proposals for leisure facilities should also refer
to Policy SC 1 'Leisure and Recreation' in the Local Plan Strategy.
11.40 The council has developed a retail hierarchy of centres based on the Determining Settlement
Hierarchy Study. The Study looks at a range of factors to determine the role and function of the
borough's settlements and confirms their place in the hierarchy, which is made up of Principal Towns,
Key Service Centres, Local Service Centres and other settlements. This approach defines where
new development is best located in the borough.
11.41 In order to fully meet the identified needs of the borough, suitable sites for main town centre
uses will be allocated in the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document.
11.42 Until they are reviewed, the existing boundaries and retail allocations will remain as they are
in the 'saved' policies of the Congleton Borough Local Plan First Review, the Borough of Crewe &
Nantwich Replacement Local Plan and the Macclesfield Borough Local Plan.
11.43 All town centre boundaries, Principal Shopping Areas and primary and secondary frontages
will be defined in the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document, and shown on the Adopted
Policies Map. Detailed policies defining which uses will be permitted in these locations will also be
included in the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document.
11.44 The council is keen to preserve and enhance the vitality and viability of its existing town
centres. Therefore, it is important to make sure that proposals for town centre uses located outside
of these town centres do not have a significant adverse impact on these existing centres. These
impacts could include an increase in the number of vacant units and a reduction in turnover. More
information on town centre impacts can be found in government guidance, but the council will apply
the sequential test set out in paragraph 26 of the NPPF when determining retail applications with a
floorspace in excess of 2,500 square metres.

12.1 Cheshire East is committed to meeting the needs of its local communities and providing the
infrastructure, services and facilities required to create sustainable and stronger communities, whilst
recognising that Cheshire East covers a large geographical area and contains a large number of
towns and villages, each with its own local character and distinctiveness, which must be considered.
12.2 We also want to put local people at the heart of decision making for their community and
provide them with the ability to identify and meet their own needs, embracing the spirit of localism.
12.3 The Local Plan Strategy will provide a significant number of new homes in all parts of the
borough, to 2030, to support economic growth and sustainable development. It will make sure that
there is an appropriate mix of house types, sizes and tenures provided across the borough.
12.4 The council also faces challenges in enabling people of all ages to make provision for their
own care needs wherever possible. Good housing is essential for achieving this aim. Housing should
be readily adaptable in the face of changes in the circumstances of its occupiers. In addition, specific
provision should be made to meet the diverse needs of the borough. This can range from bespoke
housing with an element of care, through to whole life housing, the obligation to build more bungalows
and positive encouragement for dependent relative annexes.
12.5 The Local Plan Strategy will strive for a decent quality of life for all residents and will contribute
to the achievement of equality and social inclusion. It will seek to reduce poverty and to enable older
people to live independently for longer in order to achieve a better quality of life for all. It will seek to
improve human health and achieve a high quality of life by maximising opportunities to access facilities
and open space thereby encouraging a healthy and active lifestyle.
12.6 Cheshire East Council will work with infrastructure providers to make sure that the infrastructure
required to support the community is provided, including: local health and social care facilities; leisure
and community facilities; education; transport; broadband, mobile and other ICT connectivity; water;
waste water; and energy.

Leisure
12.7 Leisure opportunities bring together members of a community who work, live and play within
an area.

Stronger Communities

12.8 Leisure and sports facilities and green spaces such as parks and allotments can help to
enhance everyone’s life. Such provision is important for residents' social, mental and physical health
and well-being and to the achievement of sustainable communities.

Policy SC 1
Leisure and Recreation
In order to provide appropriate leisure and recreational facilities for the communities of Cheshire
East, the council will:

2.

Seek to protect and enhance existing leisure and recreation facilities, unless a needs
assessment has clearly proven them to be surplus to requirements to local community
needs or unless alternative provision, of equivalent or better quality, is to be made.
Support and promote the provision of better leisure, community and recreation facilities,
where there is a need for such facilities, the proposed facilities are of a type and scale
appropriate to the size of the settlement, are accessible and support the objectives of the
Local Plan Strategy. The council will:
i.

ii.
iii.

iv.

3.

Encourage facilities that serve the borough as a whole, and facilities that attract large
numbers of people, to be located, where possible, within or adjoining Crewe or
Macclesfield town centres;
Require facilities serving Key Service Centres to be located in or adjacent to their town
centre or highly accessible locations;
Require facilities intended to serve the everyday needs of a community or
neighbourhood to be in or adjacent to the centres of Local Service Centres or other
settlements; and
Encourage the development of shared service centres that combine public services,
health and community functions in modern accessible buildings.

Support proposals for facilities that would not be appropriate to be located in or adjacent
to centres, provided they are highly accessible by a choice of transport, do not harm the
character, amenity, or biodiversity value of the area, and satisfy the following criteria:
i.

The proposal is a facility that:
a.
b.
c.
d.

4.
5.

supports a business use;
is appropriate in an employment area; or
supports an outdoor sports facility, education or related community / visitor facility;
or
supports the visitor economy and is based on local cultural or existing visitor
attractions.

Work with agencies, services and businesses responsible for providing facilities to make
sure that the needs and demands of communities are met.
Make sure that appropriate developments contribute, through land assembly and financial
contributions, to new or improved facilities where development will increase demand and /
(46)
or there is a recognised shortage of local leisure, community and recreation facilities.

Justification
12.9 The National Planning Policy Framework states that Local Planning Authorities should 'allocate
a range of suitable sites to meet the scale and type of . . . leisure . . . development needed in town
centres. It is important that needs for . . . leisure . . . are met in full' and 'deliver sufficient community
and cultural facilities and services to meet local needs'. The policy covers indoor leisure, community
and recreation facilities. Community halls for example can be a focus for indoor recreation such as

bowls and exercise classes. Policy SE 6 in the Sustainable Environment Chapter covers outdoor
open space such as parks and allotments.
12.10 Major facilities that attract a large number of people should be sited in accessible locations,
and the council will encourage such facilities to be located within or adjoining the two principal towns
of Crewe and Macclesfield, where this is possible. If this is not possible, other accessible locations
include town centres. Smaller facilities should be located close to existing centres where possible,
or close to the communities they are serving. Where sites are not available in centres, other accessible
locations will be acceptable subject to their impact on surrounding uses. Accessibility is a critical
issue for community facilities as they are used by all groups, including those without access to a car
and those with restricted mobility. Young people and elderly persons can be disadvantaged in terms
of accessibility to community facilities and therefore accessibility by public transport and safe pedestrian
routes are essential.
12.11 Focusing major facilities in town centres not only ensures good standards of accessibility
but also helps to ensure vibrant and viable town centres. Major out-of-town centre leisure facilities
are not encouraged, however, it is accepted that some facilities serve a very local need or will only
be viable in locations outside centres. Consequently, the policy seeks to ensure that their impact is
not harmful to the surrounding area.
12.12 The council will work with other agencies and the voluntary and private sectors, to secure
more and better facilities through joint working. Shared centres where public health facilities, council
offices, libraries, police and other services are in one building can be cost-effective and more
convenient for the public and are, therefore, supported.
12.13 Although facilities may become surplus to requirements based on their current use, this may
allow other leisure and recreation needs of local communities to be met through their re-use.

Indoor and Outdoor Sports Facilities
Policy SC 2
Indoor and Outdoor Sports Facilities
In order to provide appropriate sports facilities for the communities of Cheshire East, the council
will:
1.

Protect existing indoor and outdoor sports facilities, unless:
Either:
i.
ii.

(47)

They are proven to be surplus to need ; or
(48)
Improved alternative provision
will be created in a location well related to the
functional requirements of the relocated use and its existing and future users.

And in all cases:
iii.

2.

Support new indoor and outdoor sports facilities where:
i.
ii.
iii.

3.

The proposal would not result in the loss of an area important for its amenity or
contribution to the character of the area in general; and

They are readily accessible by public transport, walking and cycling; and
The proposed facilities are of a type and scale appropriate to the size of the settlement;
and
Where they are listed in an action plan in any emerging or subsequently adopted Sports
Strategy.

Make sure that major residential developments contribute, through land assembly and / or
financial contributions, to new or improved sports facilities where development will increase
demand and/or there is a recognised shortage in the locality that would be exacerbated by
the increase in demand arising from the development.

Justification
12.14 Publicly accessible urban open space, play and sports facilities all have a vital role to play
in helping to promote more healthy lifestyles.

As identified in an adopted and up to date Needs Assessment.
Improved alternative provision means a full quantity and quality replacement to accord with paragraph 74 of the NPPF
and Sport England policy.

Stronger Communities

12.15 The existing outdoor and built sports facilities of the borough represent important assets
serving the communities in which they are located and in some instances the wider area. This
importance relates to their function and also the amenity value and the contribution these facilities
make to providing green spaces within the area.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

109

12.16 Any proposal affecting an indoor or outdoor sports facility will be judged in relation to any
emerging or subsequently adopted Indoor Sports Strategy or Playing Pitch Strategy.
12.17 The type and scale of development appropriate to a settlement will depend upon a number
of factors:

47
48

The demand and supply factors in relation to the particular indoor or outdoor sports being catered
for, for example, a combined sports facility catering for local football clubs in an area which may
serve a wider area than the adjacent settlement;
The classification of the settlement within the settlement hierarchy;
The proximity of other settlements and facilities; and
Accessibility and infrastructure considerations, for example, traffic impact.
12.18 In terms of the development of appropriate facilities, this will be determined through evidence
from the Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy process, other work with the community
and sports bodies, to determine a particular club or community’s needs. The council is expected to
introduce the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the balance between what monies are collected
between Section 106 agreements (S106) and CIL will be part of this process. The level of contributions
will be determined through the S106 and CIL setting agenda.
12.19 Policy SE 6 in the Sustainable Environment Chapter covers all outdoor open space such as
parks, allotments and playing fields; open space standards and contributions.

Health and Well-Being
12.20 Health, well-being and safety are major issues on the local and national agenda, and are
closely interrelated. Health is about more than access to medical treatment and services. It is about
lifestyle, including routine exercise and fitness for all ages and interests. It is also about living in a
safe environment and feeling part of the community. The Joint Strategic Needs Assessment approach
to addressing health issues includes these wider determinants of health and should be used to inform
planning.

12.21 The planning system can play an important role in facilitating social interaction and creating
safe, healthy and inclusive communities.

Policy SC 3
Health and Well-Being
The council and its partners will create and safeguard opportunities for safe, healthy, fulfilling
and active lifestyles by:
1.
2.

Working in partnership with the health and social care providers to improve health across
Cheshire East and reduce inequalities;
Requiring Screening or Rapid Impact Assessments as part of the application process on
all major development proposals. This will involve a review of the possible health impacts
of a policy or proposal. Screening should include:
i.
ii.
iii.

Who may be affected by the proposal;
What determinants of health may be affected; and
What further evidence is needed to inform the recommendations.

Screening will determine if a full Health Impact Assessment is required. The council will
seek contributions towards new or enhanced health and social care facilities from developers
where development results in a shortfall or worsening of provision;
3.

4.
5.

6.

Ensuring new developments provide opportunities for healthy living and improve health and
well-being through the encouragement of walking and cycling, good housing design (including
the minimisation of social isolation and creation of inclusive communities), access to services,
sufficient open space and other green infrastructure, and sports facilities and opportunity
for recreation and sound safety standards;
Improving education and skills training and encouraging life-long learning;
Protecting existing community infrastructure and ensuring the provision of a network of
community facilities, providing essential public services together with private and voluntary
sector facilities, to meet the needs of the local community;
Ensuring all development is designed to create safe environments by:
Ensuring the natural surveillance of streets and public spaces;
Providing convenient, well designed, all weather, safe access and movement routes
for all;
iii. Promoting activity that is appropriate to the area, by encouraging a diversity of uses
(where appropriate) to extend activity to ensure the safe use of spaces during the day
and night;
iv. Encourage green spaces and play areas to be located away from main roads;
v. Creating a sense of ownership by providing a clear definition between public and
private realm;
vi. Ensuring security measures are sympathetically incorporated into the design;
vii. Ensuring the layout and use of new developments are appropriate and compatible
with an area. Any new open space should be well defined, flexible and purposeful;
and
viii. Strongly encouraging the reuse of vacant and derelict buildings and spaces;

7.

Promoting the role of communal growing spaces including allotments, garden plots within
developments, small scale agriculture and farmers' markets in providing access to healthy,
affordable, locally produced food options.

Justification
12.22 The Health and Social Care Act 2012 places a duty upon local authorities to take such steps
as it considers appropriate for improving the health of the people in its area.

12.23 One of the Core Principles of the National Planning Policy Framework states that planning
should 'take account of and support local strategies to improve health, social and cultural wellbeing
for all, and deliver sufficient community and cultural facilities and services to meet local needs'.
12.24 Life expectancy in Cheshire East is higher than regional (North West) and the national
(England) averages. Life expectancy at birth for females is 83.3 years, compared to 81.5 years in
the North West and 82.9 years nationally. Life expectancy at birth for males is 80.1 years, compared
(49)
to 77.4 in the North West and 78.9 nationally . However, there are pockets of poor health: there is
a gap of around 10 years in male life expectancy and nearly 15 years for female life expectancy
(50)
between some of the local areas within Cheshire East .
12.25 Population projections produced by the Office for National Statistics and locally produced
population forecasts produced for the Local Plan both suggest that the number of people aged 65
years and over will continue to increase, with those aged 85 years and over likely to increase at the
fastest rate. This is partly due to increased longevity, but is also a consequence of the age structure
of the population and in particular the ageing of the large number of people born during the post World
War 2 baby boom.
12.26 Having timely and easy access to a range of health and social care services and community
infrastructure is a key issue for local people and creating opportunities for healthier and more active
lifestyles is part of evolving national policy. The Joint Strategic Needs Assessment highlights that
'adult participation in physical activity, as measured through sport and active recreation, in Cheshire
East is generally similar to the national average, whilst activity rates are lowest in Crewe and Nantwich
and highest in Macclesfield. Physical activity is important in childhood to support healthy growth and
development, psychological well-being and social interaction. Obesity in childhood can lead to risks
of coronary heart disease, strokes and poor mental health in later life, all causes of premature death.
Across Cheshire East, 8.2 per cent of all children were obese in 2010 although this is less than the
(51)
national average (9.6 per cent)'
.
12.27 Encouraging residents to live a healthy lifestyle involves the provision of facilities to encourage
regular exercise, maximising the opportunities provided by the natural landscape of the borough to
improve their health. The Public Health Outcomes Framework for England (2013) sets the context
for local areas to decide what public health interventions they will make. It sets out two overarching
outcomes:

Stronger Communities

i.
ii.

112

Increased life expectancy; and
Reduced differences in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy between communities.

12.28 Section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 requires local authorities to do all they
reasonably can to prevent crime and disorder and stipulates that the prevention of crime and the
enhancement of community safety are matters that a local planning authority should consider in its
plans and decisions. Crime and the fear of crime have a great impact on quality of life and general
well-being, meaning that designing high quality and safe developments is an important aspect of
creating places where people want to live, work and play. A contributory factor to improving safety
is to create and sustain a ‘sense of place’, where people take pride in their surroundings. It will also
be important to ensure that new developments are designed to a high standard and incorporate the
key principles of good design as set out in ‘By Design’ (DETR 2000). The production of a Design and
Access Statement is an important part of development proposals (see Policy SE 1 'Design').
Developers should request Crime Impact Statements (CIS) from their relevant Police Crime
Commissioner body (PCC) to assist with the completion of the 'safer communities' section of the
Design and Access Statement.
12.29 Any future Cheshire East Council policy on Health Impact Assessments will set out when a
HIA is required in relation to new development. This policy (SC 3) will then be applied to new
development in relation to Criterion 2.

Residential Mix
12.30 A neighbourhood with a mix of housing tenures, types and sizes will be more able to meet
the changing needs and aspirations of its residents, through changing life stages, household shapes
and sizes or changes in income. Providing greater housing choice increases the opportunities for
households to remain within their communities and promotes social equality and inclusion by easing
geographical constraints on the search for appropriate homes.

Policy SC 4
Residential Mix
1.

3.

New residential development should maintain, provide or contribute to a mix of housing
tenures, types and sizes to help support the creation of mixed, balanced and inclusive
communities. This could include Key Worker Housing and people wishing to build or
commission their own home.
To meet the needs arising from the increasing longevity of the borough’s older residents,
the council will require developers to demonstrate how their proposal will be capable of
meeting, and adapting to, the long term needs of this specific group of people. This would
include the provision of a variety of dwelling types and other measures to support Health
and Wellbeing and independent living through new developments that recognise the needs
of older people, those with dementia and other vulnerable people; this will include developing
dementia-friendly communities.
Development proposals for accommodation designed specifically for the elderly and people
who require specialist accommodation will be supported where there is a proven need; they
are located within settlements; accessible by public transport; and within a reasonable
walking distance of community facilities such as shops, medical services and public open
space.

12.31 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'to deliver a wide choice of high quality
homes, widen opportunities for home ownership and create sustainable, inclusive and mixed
communities, local planning authorities should:
plan for a mix of housing based on current and future demographic trends, market trends and
the needs of different groups in the community (such as, but not limited to, families with children,
older people, people with disabilities, service families and people wishing to build their own
homes);
identify the size, type, tenure and range of housing that is required in particular locations, reflecting
local demand'.
12.32 In order to create mixed, balanced and inclusive communities, provision will need to be made
for a variety of housing tenures, types and sizes. An appropriate mix of housing will need to be
provided within individual developments, proportionate to the scale of development proposed. Smaller

schemes will need to contribute to the mix of housing across the wider area. The mix of housing will
be expected to include properties for key workers and for those who wish to self build or commission
their own home. The council will keep a register of those who are seeking to acquire serviced plots
of land in the plan area to build homes for themselves to occupy and will seek to supplement this
with information from secondary data sources to obtain a robust assessment of demand for this type
of housing. Further details of how this housing mix will be taken into consideration will be set out in
a Supplementary Planning Document and the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document.
12.33 Facilitating more balanced communities, comprising a range of ages, household types and
incomes may also help achieve wider social policy goals, such as reducing concentrations of income
poverty and social exclusion.
12.34 The council will work in partnership, with developers and registered providers, to provide
accommodation with a greater range of tenure options that is of good quality and good design, offering
longevity and flexibility for the changing needs of ageing. Appropriate sites to meet this specific
housing need will be identified within the Strategic Sites of the Local Plan Strategy and the Site
Allocations and Policies Development Plan Document. The council may also seek a proportion of the
overall housing land target to be developed as bungalows or houses suitable for older person
households.
12.35 In the interests of sustainability and to ensure that new housing provision is sited in the most
appropriate location, the council will require proposals for the elderly and/or specialist housing
accommodation to be supported by evidence that there is a proven need for such accommodation.
12.36 The council will encourage the completion of Building for Life Assessments to ensure high
quality residential development that meets the needs of all.
12.37 Neighbourhood Plans can play an important role in securing an appropriate housing mix.
Their policies can reflect more local evidence regarding the need for particular types of housing.

7.

8.

9.

In developments of 15 or more dwellings (or 0.4 hectares) in the Principal Towns and
Key Service Centres at least 30% of all units are to be affordable;
In developments of 11 or more dwellings (or have a maximum combined gross
floorspace of more than 1,000 sq.m) in Local Service Centres and all other locations
at least 30% of all units are to be affordable;
In future, where Cheshire East Council evidence, such as housing needs studies or
housing market assessments, indicate a change in the borough’s housing need the
above thresholds and percentage requirements may be varied;

Units provided shall remain affordable for future eligible households or for the subsidy to
be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision;
The affordable homes provided must be of a tenure, size and type to help meet identified
housing needs and contribute to the creation of mixed, balanced and inclusive communities
where people can live independently longer;
Affordable homes should be dispersed throughout the site, unless there are specific
circumstances or benefits that would warrant a different approach;
Market and affordable homes on sites should be indistinguishable and achieve the same
high design quality;
The council will seek to improve choice and increase supply of affordable homes to reflect
that housing markets change over periods of time and therefore the products that are made
available to help people access rented and other affordable housing need to change to
meet these market conditions;
In exceptional circumstances, where scheme viability may be affected, developers will be
expected to provide viability assessments to demonstrate alternative affordable housing
(53)
provision . The developer will be required to submit an open book viability assessment.
In such cases, the council will commission an independent review of the viability study, for
which the developer will bear the cost. In cases where such alternative affordable housing
provision is agreed there may be a requirement for the provision of 'overage' payments to
be made. This will reflect the fact that the viability of a site will be agreed at a point in time
and may need to be reviewed, at set point(s) in the future;
Affordable housing is required to be provided on-site, however, in exceptional circumstances,
where it can be proven that on-site delivery is not possible, as a first alternative, off-site
provision of affordable housing will be accepted; as a second alternative a financial
contribution may be accepted, where justified, in lieu of on-site provision.
Affordable housing and tariff style contributions will not be sought from any development
consisting only of the construction of a residential annex or extension to an existing home.

Justification
12.39 The National Planning Policy Framework states that where Local Authorities have identified
that affordable housing is needed, they should 'set policies for meeting this need on site, unless
off-site provision or a financial contribution of broadly equivalent value can be robustly justified and
the agreed approach contributes to the objective of creating mixed and balanced communities. Such
policies should be sufficiently flexible to take account of changing market conditions over time'.

Alternative affordable housing provision could include lower provision or provision of alternative affordable housing
tenures.

12.40 'Affordable housing' and 'Affordable homes' are considered to be that as defined in the
National Planning Policy Framework.
12.41 A community's need for an appropriate balance and mix of housing, including the provision
of affordable housing, is recognised at national level as a material consideration in determining
planning applications for housing development. Government policy seeks to create sustainable
communities that offer a wide range of housing types and tenures and are socially inclusive.
12.42 The council is keen to enable people to live independently at all stages of their lives and to
reduce cultures of dependency. The council is also keen to enable people to buy a home of their
own and promote wider home ownership. It also encourages families to grow and move into homes
that match their current and future aspirations. There needs to be a wider choice of housing that can
support people when they are older and allow them to remain independent for as much of their life
as possible. Affordable housing is a means of achieving these goals; it can support broader home
ownership through initiatives such as housing designed specifically for first time buyers and can allow
families to grow through fixed discount and shared ownership housing. Securing housing at the right
price supports a flexible and dynamic labour market and enhances the wider growth agenda. Housing
that meets the needs of older people will be increasingly important as longevity improves; the right
kind of housing, bungalows or directly supported housing promotes independence and reduces the
need to fall back on the care system. Consequently, a good range of housing that meets local needs
is vital to the overall strategy.
12.43 Although the borough has a stock of good quality housing with relatively low vacancy rates,
in many areas there is an imbalance in the type and tenure of available housing. There is a need to
make sure that future housing development in Cheshire East helps to support economic growth by
providing for a range of income groups. This includes housing for households seeking open market
dwellings and those requiring affordable housing (including social rented, affordable rent, shared
ownership housing, discounted housing for sale and increased diversity of options through intermediate
tenures). Such an approach will help to maintain long-term community sustainability and enhance
the quality of life for local residents.
12.44 The Housing Development Study shows that there is the objectively-assessed need for
affordable housing for a minimum of 7,100 dwellings over the plan period, which equates to an average
of 355 dwellings per year.
12.45 To help address housing need, the council will seek affordable housing from residential
developments in accordance with the stated thresholds.

Stronger Communities

12.46 All development involving the provision of housing that meets the thresholds will be required
to make provision for affordable housing, unless there are exceptional viability circumstances which
make this impossible. Land values used in any viability assessments will be expected to take account
of planning obligations.

116

12.47 The council will normally require the affordable housing to be delivered without public subsidy
and provided on site. In exceptional circumstances and where it can be justified, as a first alternative,
affordable housing will be accepted off-site; this must be on a site that is agreed with the Council as
being in a suitable location, relative to the housing need to be met. In exceptional circumstances and
where it can be justified, as a second alternative, a financial contribution will be accepted. Where a
financial contribution is sought, the Council will seek to use a standard methodology which will be
detailed in additional guidance and based on evidence such as the Strategic Housing Market
Assessment, local housing needs surveys and other housing market studies.
12.48 The council will seek the balance of housing that best meets local needs and the characteristics
of the site. Currently, this is 65% affordable (or social) rent housing and 35% intermediate affordable
housing. The council may refine both the headline percentage, tenure split and any geographical
variation as the plan progresses. Any future requirements will be determined through evidence such
as the Strategic Housing Market Assessment and local housing needs surveys.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

12.49 Affordable housing requirements must also be balanced with other requirements for transport
infrastructure, community facilities, open space and sustainable construction. However, it should be
stressed that the provision of affordable housing will be additional to any requirements outlined in the
council's Charging Schedule under the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) - see Policy IN 2. Following
the Written Ministerial Statement of the 28 November 2014 and subsequent updates to the Planning
Practice Guidance there are specific circumstances where contributions for affordable housing and
tariff style planning obligations (Section 106 planning obligations) should not be sought from small
scale and self-build development as reflected in point 1 (ii) of Policy SC 5.
12.50 The Draft Core Strategy and CIL Viability assessment (2013) noted that greenfield residential
development is generally viable at the current time at a 30% affordable housing requirement. The
assessment acknowledges challenges, however, in respect of the viability of brownfield development
in meeting the 30% requirement with particular issues around the urban area of Crewe. Point 7 of
Policy SC 5 allows for the viability of schemes to be a key consideration in demonstrating an alternative
affordable housing provision alongside an open book viability assessment, in order to consider
schemes on a case by case basis.
12.51 In Crewe it may also be more appropriate to divert funding for affordable housing into
provisions for the improvement of existing stock within the urban area, rather than the provision of
new houses. This will not only make best use of available resources but have regeneration benefits
as well.
12.52 Where viability assessments are submitted, to demonstrate that an alternative provision of
affordable housing should be provided, they will be evaluated independently, such cost being borne
by the developer. In cases where such alternative affordable housing provision is agreed, there may
be a requirement for the provision of 'overage' payments to be made. As viability assessments are
relevant to a particular point in time, this would be linked to reviews of the viability assessment, at
certain points within the site's lifetime. Such a requirement will be related to the site's size; its
characteristics; market conditions and other relevant factors.

12.54 Approximately 30% of Cheshire East's population live in Local Service Centres (LSCs), Other
Settlements and rural areas. The provision of additional housing is vital to the creation and maintenance
of sustainable communities in rural areas. Further supply is required to address the cost of housing,
and to enable newly forming households to remain in their communities. Additional housing can also
help to improve the viability of existing or potential local services.

Policy SC 6
Rural Exceptions Housing for Local Needs
Rural Exceptions affordable housing will be permitted as an exception to other policies concerning
the countryside, to meet locally identified affordable housing need, subject to all of the following
criteria being met:

Sites should adjoin Local Service Centres and Other Settlements and be close to existing
employment and existing or proposed services and facilities,including public transport,
educational and health facilities and retail services;
Proposals must be for small schemes; small schemes are considered to be those of 10
(54)
dwellings or fewer . Any such developments must be appropriate in scale, design and
character to the locality;
A thorough site options appraisal must be submitted to demonstrate why the site is the most
suitable one. Such an appraisal must demonstrate why the need cannot be met within the
settlement;
In all cases, proposals for rural exceptions housing schemes must be supported by an
(55)
(56)
up-to-date
Housing Needs Survey
that identifies the need for such provision within
the parish;
Occupancy will, in perpetuity, be restricted to a person in housing need and resident or
working in the relevant parish, or who has other strong links with the relevant locality in line
with the community connection criteria as set out by Cheshire Homechoice, both initially
and on subsequent change of occupancy. This could include Key Workers and Self Build;
The locality to which the occupancy criteria are to be applied is taken as the parish, unless
otherwise agreed with Cheshire East Council;
To ensure that a property is let or sold to a person who either lives locally or has strong
local connections in the future, the council will expect there to be a 'cascade' approach to
the locality issue appropriate to the type of tenure. Thus, first priority is to be given to those
satisfying the occupancy criteria in relation to the parish, widening in agreed geographical
(57)
stages .

Cross Subsidy

Proposals must consist in their entirety of affordable housing that will be retained in
perpetuity. In exceptional circumstances, proposals that intend to include an element of
market housing, or plots for open market sale, may be acceptable, if they meet all of the
above criteria, along with the criteria below:

Such proposals will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that the site would
not be viable, as a rural exception site, without cross subsidy. The developer will be
required to submit an open book viability assessment. In such cases, the Council will
commission an independent review of the viability study, for which the developer will
bear the cost;
The Council will not accept aspirational land value as justification for allowing a higher
proportion of market value units;
The assessment must show that the scale of the market housing component is essential
for the successful delivery of the rural exception affordable housing scheme and that
it is based on reasonable land values as a rural exception site and must not include
an element of profit;
The majority of the development must be for rural exception affordable housing; and
No additional subsidy is required for the scheme.

The scale of a Rural Exception site should broadly reflect the affordable housing need appropriate to the parish in
which it is situated. The housing need identified in the local housing needs survey is an important factor, however, if
a higher housing need is identified (greater than 10 dwellings), then it will be considered appropriate for development
of more than one site to meet this need.
Within the last five years.
Cheshire East Council has up-to-date Housing Needs Surveys for many rural areas which may be utilised. Where
an up-to-date survey does not already exist, the applicant must conduct a survey, based on the Cheshire East Council
model survey, in conjunction with the parish council where possible.
Generally this is taken as the parish and then parish plus adjoining parishes.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Justification
12.55 The National Planning Policy Framework states that in rural areas 'local planning authorities
should be responsive to local circumstances and plan housing development to reflect local needs,
particularly for affordable housing, including through rural exception sites where appropriate. Local
planning authorities should in particular consider whether allowing some market housing would
facilitate the provision of significant additional affordable housing to meet local needs'. Whilst paragraph
89 states ‘a local planning authority should regard the construction of new buildings as inappropriate
in Green Belt. Exceptions to this are: . . . and limited affordable housing for local community needs
under policies set out in the Local Plan’.
12.56 This policy allows for the allocation of, or granting of planning permission for, small sites
comprising affordable housing to meet local needs as an exception to normal policies. The policy
sets out the criteria against which such proposals will be evaluated and under what circumstances
schemes solely for affordable housing may be permitted.
12.57 The council recognises the particular difficulties in securing an adequate supply of housing
for local needs in rural areas. Where it can be demonstrated that a proposed development will meet
a particular locally generated need that cannot be accommodated in any other way, affordable housing
will be allowed as an exception to normal policy.
12.58 A number of rural exception sites have been successfully delivered in Cheshire East. However,
the delivery of such schemes can be slow and the council is keen to facilitate a higher provision of
affordable homes in rural areas in the future with a view to maintaining sustainable communities and
meeting their specific needs. This includes the provision of housing for key workers such as those
involved in health, education or emergency services. It is also recognised that Self Build could be a
way of delivering affordable housing in rural areas.
12.59 The provision of small scale market development in conjunction with affordable units will
help enable more development sites to come forward to meet local demand. The provision of a small
number of market units will also help maintain communities where development would not otherwise
occur. Such schemes will, however, only be permitted where viability assessments or some other
clear reason demonstrates that this is the only way that affordable housing to meet local needs can
be delivered on the site. The council would expect such schemes to be developed with support from
parish councils and the Rural Housing Strategy.

Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling Showpeople
12.62 Many Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople wish to find and buy their own sites
to develop and manage, but have often been unable to secure planning permission to do so. Others
require space to rent for pitching caravans – usually on sites owned and run by a Local Authority.
An increase in the number of approved sites will help to meet demand for affordable Gypsy, Traveller
and Travelling Showpeople accommodation. A more settled existence can benefit many members
of these communities in terms of access to health and education services and employment, and can
contribute to greater integration and social inclusion within local communities.

Policy SC 7

There will be a presumption against the loss of existing permanent consented Gypsy,

identified shortfall unless suitable replacement provision of equal or enhanced value are
provided.

Justification
12.63 The Department of Communities and Local Government's Policy for Travellers states that
'Local planning authorities should set pitch targets for Gypsies and Travellers and plot targets for
Travelling Showpeople which address the likely permanent and transit site accommodation needs of
Travellers in their area, working collaboratively with neighbouring local planning authorities'. It goes
on to suggest that 'local planning authorities should ensure that Traveller sites are sustainable
economically, socially and environmentally'.

13.1 The environment of Cheshire East is unusually rich and varied and its high quality, natural
and man-made heritage is a key asset, attractive to both residents and visitors. The Local Plan
Strategy will maintain and enhance this asset that makes a fundamental contribution to the quality
of life in Cheshire East. Development provides opportunities to enhance and contribute to the quality
of the environment.

Sustainable Environment

13.2 This section sets out positive policies to ensure that development will protect and enhance
Cheshire East's built and natural environment and will make sustainable use of resources. These
policies take account of the contribution that an attractive environment can make to a successful
economy and the well-being of local communities.

124

Figure 13.1 Environmental Assets in Cheshire East: Riverside, Nantwich; Sandbach Park, Sandbach; and the Silk
Bridge, Macclesfield

Quality of Place
13.3 High quality design is not just about how a development looks but also whether it is successful
in its context, whether it functions well, whether it is enduring and of high quality, and lastly, whether
it contributes toward broader sustainability objectives. To deliver safe, secure, attractive and healthy
places in which to live, work, visit and spend time, development should seek to improve the quality
and appearance and biodiversity value of an area and the way it functions.
13.4 Achieving high quality design should be a key objective of all those involved in delivering
sustainable development. Development should take the opportunities available to improve the quality
and appearance of an area and the way it functions.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

13.5 The NPPF places significant emphasis on achieving high quality design as part of delivering
sustainable development, stating that “The government attaches great importance to the design of
the built environment. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, is indivisible from
good planning, and should contribute positively to making places better for people.”
13.6 The National Planning Policy Framework also states that 'Permission should be refused for
development of poor design that fails to take the opportunities available for improving the character
and quality of an area and the way it functions'.

Ensuring that site layout and design minimises the opportunity for crime.

Justification
13.7 Cheshire East has a unique character and sense of place and it is important that new
development responds positively to it. High quality design should be the aim of all those involved in
the development process and should be considered at the earliest possible stage. Development
proposals should, therefore, consider the wider character in addition to that of the site and its immediate
context, to ensure that it reinforces the area in which it is located. Where there is the opportunity to
improve the area, the design should secure a positive new character, enhancing both its appearance
and the way that it functions.

Sustainable Environment

13.8 A genuinely sustainable form of development should be underpinned by sustainable urban,
architectural and landscape design. Both outline and detailed proposals should demonstrate their
performance in respect to sustainable design, commensurate with the type and scale of the application.

126

13.9 Development should have due regard to the site and wider setting in respect to layout,
movement and connections, scale and height, landscape character, townscape character and in their
appearance both in terms of architectural quality and materials. Development should also ensure
high levels of passive surveillance of streets, spaces and parking through the arrangement and design
of buildings, streets and spaces and the activity within them. Boundary treatments and hard surfaces
are equally important to successful design.
13.10 In rural areas, particular attention should be paid to landscape character, the local vernacular
and the peculiar characteristics of the locality. These will vary considerably within Cheshire East and
new development should be designed with a distinctive sense of place in mind.
13.11 Consequently, it is important that new development has a strong design vision, formed early
in the process, in order to create a strong sense of place and to fully address both the opportunities
and constraints of the site and the wider area.
13.12 Proposals for new development should express how the design achieves this in the Design
and Access Statement. This should not merely be a statement of what the proposal is or looks like
but must set out the ‘story’ of the design (i.e. the design process that has been followed) and how it
has evolved and strengthened. The design process can be summarised as:

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Stage 1: analysis: research and analyse the physical, environmental, economic and social
considerations. Identify issues and opportunities, not just for the site but the wider area (extent
dependent on the scale and complexity of the proposals);
Stage 2: concepts: Establish the design vision, set out the principles and parameters and
potentially several sketch options (depending on the nature and scale of the development)
Potential stage for design review;
Stage 3: Design development: test and refine the design, potentially including selecting a preferred
approach (if several options have been developed in stage 2). Ironing out of issues highlighted
and strengthening of the scheme;
Potential stage for design review and/or consultation;
Stage 4: final design: Final refinement and preparation of the final design and assembly of all
supporting material including visual representations appropriate to the scale and type of
application (potentially 2D and 3D).
13.13 Detailed design policies will be included in the Site Allocations and Development Policies
Document. Design policies will also be supplemented by Supplementary Planning Document(s) on
Design.

Justification
13.15 The National Planning Policy Framework identifies the efficient use of land as one of the
core land use planning principles which encourages ‘the effective use of land by re-using land that
has been previously developed (brownfield land), provided that it is not of high environmental value’.
13.16 Not all areas of previously-developed land will however be suitable or appropriate for built
development, nor for the whole curtilage to be developed. The council will therefore seek to resist
inappropriate development where development would cause harm to the character of the surrounding
area. The council recognises that there is a presumption in favour of sustainable development in
accordance with paragraph 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework. The council will therefore
seek to ensure that, where possible, development is making the best use of land and existing
infrastructure, and that resources are being managed prudently and efficiently. It is not always possible
to predict where sites and buildings will become available and therefore it is not always possible to
allocate such sites for development. At the same time, the council would like to see these sites brought
back into use, not only in relation to the prudent use of resources but also to make sure that an area
is not blighted by dereliction and vacancy, and to reduce opportunities for any criminal and anti-social
activity to take place on the site. The council recognises that good design is an important aspect of
sustainable development and therefore when planning for any development, including windfall sites
'it is important to plan positively for the achievement of high quality and inclusive design for all
development, including individual buildings, public and private spaces and wider area development
schemes' (NPPF).
13.17 The NPPF states that "Local planning authorities should take into account the economic and
other benefits of the best and most versatile agricultural land'". Cheshire is a major food producing
county and fertile soil is a limited and finite resource that cannot easily be repaired or replicated.
Accordingly whilst some reduction of agricultural land is inevitable if new development is to proceed,
its loss should be minimised. The needs of future generations for all forms of development should
be balanced against the inevitable requirement to provide food for future needs.
13.18 Cheshire East has a wealth of mineral resources; these must be worked where they are
found (see Policy SE 10). The ability to access key minerals should be safeguarded.

13.19 Cheshire East has a distinct natural environment that contributes to the creation of an attractive
and successful place. The landscape of the borough is dominated by the flat topography of the
Cheshire Plain containing a number of meres, ponds and marshes; variety is provided as a result of
the closeness of the Peak District to the east and the Mid-Cheshire Ridge to the west. The natural
environment of the borough is diverse, supporting a variety of habitats, flora and fauna.
13.20 The natural environment is one of the borough's greatest assets and is highly valued by
residents and visitors alike. Protecting and enhancing the environment that makes Cheshire East

development, at this site, clearly outweigh both the impacts that it is likely to have on the
features of the site that make it of special scientific interest and any broader impacts on the
national network of Sites of Special Scientific Interest.
Development proposals which are likely to have a significant adverse impact on a site with
one or more of the following local or regional designations, habitats or species will not be

will be put in place to make sure appropriate monitoring is undertaken and make sure
mitigation, compensation and offsetting is effective.
Development proposals that are likely to have a significant impact on a non-designated
asset or a site valued by the local community identified in a Neighbourhood Plan or the Site
Allocations and Development Policies documents will only be permitted where suitable
mitigation and / or compensation is provided to address the adverse impacts of the proposed
development, or where any residual harm following mitigation/compensation, along with
any other harm, is clearly outweighed by the benefits of the development.

Justification
13.21 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'planning permission will be refused for
development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats including ancient woodland
and the loss of aged veteran trees outside ancient woodland, unless the need for, and the benefits
of, the development in that locality clearly outweighs the loss'. It also states that 'to minimise impacts
on biodiversity and geodiversity, planning policies should: plan for biodiversity at a landscape-scale...;
identify and map components of the local ecological networks, including the hierarchy of international,
national and locally designated sites...; promote the preservation, restoration and re-creation of priority
habitats, ecological networks and the protection and recovery of priority species populations...; and
aim to prevent harm to geological conservation interests'.
13.22 The National Planning Policy Framework also states that 'The planning system should
contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by . . . minimising impacts on biodiversity
and providing net gains in biodiversity where possible, contributing to the government's commitment
to halt the overall decline in biodiversity, including by establishing coherent ecological networks that
are more resilient to current and future pressures'.

Sustainable Environment

13.23 The Natural Environment White Paper 'The Natural Choice: Securing the Value of Nature'
states that 'We want to create a resilient and coherent ecological network at national and local levels
across England….To make this happen, the government will put in place a clear institutional framework
to support nature restoration. This means: establishing Local Nature Partnerships….Creating new
Nature Improvement Areas (NIAs) and strengthening support through the planning system'.

to achieve this. Biodiversity offsetting is described in the Natural Environment White Paper 'The
Natural Choice: securing the value of nature' as 'conservation activities designed to deliver biodiversity
benefits in compensation for losses in a measurable way. Good developments incorporate biodiversity
considerations in their design but are still likely to result in some biodiversity loss. One way to
compensate for this loss is by offsetting: the developer secures compensatory habitat expansion or
restoration elsewhere'.
13.25 The level of biodiversity offsetting required could be determined by means of assessments
undertaken in accordance with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
metric contained in Biodiversity Offsetting Pilots published in March 2012 as applied in the Defra
offsetting pilot projects. Biodiversity offsetting could be delivered by developers in partnership with
various partners including conservation organisations, local landowners and the borough council.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

13.26 The designation of international, national and local sites is an on-going process, therefore
the above policy will equally apply to any sites selected or designated subsequently to the adoption
of the Local Plan. Conversely, the policy will not apply to any site de-selected after the adoption of
the Local Plan. Sites of Biological Importance are being resurveyed; they will then be designated as
Local Wildlife Sites. At the time of producing this document, there are therefore sites that are designated
as Sites of Biological Importance (which have yet to be resurveyed) and sites that are designated as
Local Wildlife Sites (which have been resurveyed.)
13.27 The policy recognises that in rare and closely defined circumstances, proposals that have
an adverse impact on a European site (or equivalent for planning policy purposes) may be permitted.
This aligns with the legal framework governing these designations of international importance.
13.28 Construction Management Plans, landscaping, green infrastructure and open space proposals
should be submitted to the council during the planning application process as part of sustainable
development proposals for any sites in close proximity to European designated sites.
13.29 The importance of biodiversity has been a common theme within Neighbourhood Plans in
Cheshire East. Where supported by local evidence, there is an opportunity for communities to identify
sites of nature conservation importance as Local Green Space designations to further support the
aims of Policy SE 3.

Landscape

Sustainable Environment

13.30 Cheshire East has a rich and diverse landscape. To the east, the land rises from the Cheshire
Plain into the Pennine foothills and the Derbyshire and Staffordshire boundaries. In the south east,
it includes the southern part of the Sandstone Ridge that runs north-south from Frodsham to Whitchurch
and the rolling landscape of the Shropshire boundary. The Plain itself consists of a mosaic of clay
plain, heathland, meres and mosses, shallow river valleys – Weaver, Wheelock, Dane and Bollin,
and salt related landscapes around Middlewich and Sandbach. Much of the Plain has a pastoral
landscape of hedgerows, hedgerow trees and ponds, which provides an impression of a well wooded
landscape, but in fact woodland cover is one of the lowest in England and many of the hedgerow
trees are slowly disappearing from the landscape.

Making suitable provision for better public access to, and enjoyment of, the Local
Landscape Designation Areas;
(64)

Where development may affect a local or national
designation a full understanding of
the context, characteristics and significance should be provided and informed by the Cheshire
East Landscape Character Assessment, Historic Landscape Assessment and the Local
Landscape Designation Study. In Local Landscape Designation Areas, Cheshire East will
seek to conserve and enhance the quality of the landscape and to protect it from development
which is likely to have an adverse effect on its character and appearance.

Sustainable Environment

Justification

132

13.31 The conservation of the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside is a core planning
principle in the NPPF and it is important to understand the characteristics of the local landscape and
how development may affect it. Development should contribute to the enhancement of landscape
character, both urban and rural and should also protect and manage the historic, natural features
and characteristics that contribute to local distinctiveness.
13.32 The Cheshire East area is a significant landscape asset in the North West which is enjoyed
and valued for, amongst other things, its ecological, recreational, agricultural, conservation and
aesthetic aspects. This is reflected in both the quantity and quality of landscape designations which
protect specific areas and in the high profile given to the environment in the council’s key objectives.
13.33 Landscape encompasses all outdoor space, from town centre pedestrian precincts, to the
open countryside: all forms of development impact upon the landscape to some degree and this
needs to be assessed to determine its significance, ensure development is designed to integrate into
its setting and to identify possible mitigation (be they proposals for stables, householder applications,

new residential development, business parks, new town centre buildings, public art, telecommunications
masts, wind farms, nursing homes, nurseries, new retail, overhead power lines, new recreational
landscapes such as golf courses and many others).
13.34 Whilst all of Cheshire East’s landscapes are of value, some landscapes are also recognised
as being of particular importance and have been identified as Local Landscape Designation areas;
these areas sit within the framework of the Landscape Character Assessment. Criteria for defining
the special qualities of these areas include: distinctiveness, perceptual character, landscape and
scenic quality, natural character, cultural character and function. Further guidance and/or design
advice will be published for areas of particular distinctiveness such as the Peak District Fringe and
the Alderely Edge sandstone escarpment.
13.35 The impacts of proposed developments upon existing landscape and views of the surrounding
area should be assessed as part of the planning process. This can include assessing the suitability
of landscape schemes (often submitted as part of a planning application), and negotiating any
improvements. With larger projects, for example mineral applications, this can involve a series of
meetings and site visits with the applicant’s planning consultants to provide advice.

Trees, Hedgerows and Woodland

Sustainable Environment

13.36 Woodland, trees and hedgerows within Cheshire East are important visual and ecological
assets, which not only provide a significant contribution to the borough's local distinctiveness but also
play a role in mitigating and addressing climate change and supporting biodiversity.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

133

Policy SE 5
Trees, Hedgerows and Woodland
Development proposals which will result in the loss of, or threat to, the continued health and life
expectancy of trees, hedgerows or woodlands (including veteran trees or ancient semi-natural
woodland), that provide a significant contribution to the amenity, biodiversity, landscape character
or historic character of the surrounding area, will not normally be permitted, except where there
are clear overriding reasons for allowing the development and there are no suitable alternatives.
Where such impacts are unavoidable, development proposals must satisfactorily demonstrate
a net environmental gain by appropriate mitigation, compensation or offsetting.
The council will seek to ensure:
1.

2.

The sustainable management of trees,woodland and hedgerows including provision of new
planting within the infrastructure of new development proposals to provide local
distinctiveness within the landscape, enable climate adaptation resilience, and support
biodiversity;
The planting and sustainable growth of large trees within new development as part of a
structured landscape scheme in order to retain and improve tree canopy cover within the
borough as a whole.

Justification
13.37 The National Planning Policy Framework states that ‘planning permission should be refused
for development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats, including ancient
woodland and the loss of aged or veteran trees found outside ancient woodland, unless the need for,
and benefits of, the development in that location clearly outweigh the loss’. Trees will be assessed
in accordance with the council’s Amenity Evaluation Checklist for Trees and where appropriate
protected by the imposition of Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) to safeguard their amenity value and
planning conditions to ensure protection and prevent damage during the development process.

Sustainable Environment

13.38 'Trees in Townscape', a guidance document produced by the Trees and Design Action Group,
states that ‘trees make places work, look and feel better. As well as playing a role in climate proofing
our neighbourhoods and supporting human health and environmental well-being, trees can also help
to create conditions for economic success. With over 80 per cent of the UK’s population living in
urban settings, trees in and around built-up areas – which many call the ‘urban forest’ – have become
a key component of the infrastructure that makes places work, look and feel better’.

134

13.39 The government's Forestry and Woodlands Policy Statement 2013 states that ‘the protection
of the UK’s trees, woods and forests, especially ancient woodland is a top priority’ and ‘ new and
better managed woodland also has a role in making our rural and urban landscapes more resilient
to the effects of climate change’
13.40 The UK Forestry Standard (UKFS) 2013 also sets out the government's approach to
sustainable forestry and helps inform planning decisions by summarising the legislation which affects
trees and woodlands, clarifies the role of the Forestry Commission and LPAs in respect of woodlands,
setting appropriate standards and sets appropriate standards for woodland management or creation
when covered by planning legislation.
13.41 The UK National Ecosystem Assessment (UK NEA) provides an analysis of the UK’s natural
environment in terms of the benefits provided to society and continued economic prosperity. The
Ecosystem approach encompasses social, economic and environmental factors that are interdependent
with biodiversity and various benefits that trees and woodlands provide.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

13.42 Trees and hedgerows are an important element of the landscapes and townscapes of the
area, where they can make a valuable contribution to visual amenity. They may have historic
importance, as part of wider designed landscapes or be keys to the history of the landscape by
identifying former highways, settlements or field boundaries. They may also have ecological value,
by providing habitats for legally protected and priority species. It is essential that the presence of
existing trees be considered at an early stage in the development process and that where appropriate,
provision is made for new tree planting. Whilst trees can be seen as a constraint, with sympathetic
design they can enhance a development.
13.43 Therefore development proposals which will result in the loss of trees or hedgerows that
provide a significant contribution (including trees or woodlands subject of a Tree Preservation Order,
hedgerows which are classed as ‘important’ under the Hedgerow Regulations, those classified as
UK priority habitat) will be discouraged.
13.44 The council will encourage proposals which seek to increase the planting of woodland and
hedgerows to introduce positive sustainable woodland management - particularly in urban areas and
the urban fringe, where this will contribute to the enhancement of landscape character, amenity,
recreation, health and welfare of residents, biodiversity, geological and historical conservation,
ecosystem services, tourism and the economic regeneration of the borough.

Green Infrastructure

Policy SE 6
Green Infrastructure
Cheshire East aims to deliver a good quality, and accessible network of green spaces for people
to enjoy, providing for healthy recreation and biodiversity and continuing to provide a range of
social, economic and health benefits. This will be done by:
1.

Linking the various assets of Cheshire East’s unique landscape – its upland fringes, Cheshire
Plain, lowland heath, parkland estates, rivers, canals and watercourses, valleys and cloughs,
meres and mosses, trees and woodland and wildlife habitats and its distinctive towns and
villages and their urban fringe.
i.

This network of green infrastructure assets should be safeguarded, retained and
enhanced through the development of green networks/wedges and corridors.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Sustainable Environment

13.45 Green infrastructure is a network of multi-functional green spaces, urban and rural, which
are capable of delivering a wide range of environmental and quality of life benefits for local
communities. Green infrastructure has a potentially important role to play in mitigating the impacts
of extreme weather events, particularly extended heat waves. In addition, green infrastructure helps
support biodiversity and makes an important contribution to the quality of the environment. Access
to beautiful and well-maintained green spaces such as parks and gardens, country parks and wildlife
areas, supports both physical and mental health and well-being.

Development does not compromise their integrity or potential value;
Developer contributions are secured wherever appropriate in order to improve their
quality, use and multi-functionality; and
Opportunities to add to the green infrastructure network are maximised through

Macclesfield Borough Local Plan will remain in force.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Justification
13.46 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'local planning authorities should set
out a strategic approach in their Local Plans, planning positively for the creation, protection,
enhancement and management of networks of biodiversity and green infrastructure'.
13.47 The wide variety of natural landscapes, biodiversity habitats, green spaces, rural areas and
the network of footpaths and bridleways is seen as one of the reasons why Cheshire East is such an
attractive place to live by local people. There are concerns amongst local people about potential loss
of green spaces and other places important for outdoor recreation and natural beauty and biodiversity.
The policy links with Policies SE 3 'Biodiversity and Geodiversity', SE 4 'The Landscape', SE 5 'Trees
Hedgerows and Woodlands' and SE 7 'The Historic Environment' linking all the various green assets
of Cheshire East from parks and gardens to woodland copses, hedges and ponds.
13.48 It is important to co-ordinate green infrastructure provision so that resources are used
effectively. The council’s Green Space Strategy sets out the green infrastructure assets and the
various partners involved in green space provision. It contains a vision, background evidence,
recommendations and an action plan. The council’s Open Space Assessment adds further detail at
town and village level.
13.49 Provision of multi-functional green infrastructure should create: places for outdoor relaxation
and play; space and habitat for wildlife; opportunities to access nature; climate change adaptation;
opportunities for environmental education; space for local food production; improved health and
wellbeing; reduced air, water and noise pollution; green transport routes to promote walking and
cycling; and improved quality of place. It can also play a major role in attracting economic growth
and investment, increasing land and property benefits, promoting tourism, and increasing business
productivity.
13.50 Appropriate restoration following mineral working can provide additional green infrastructure
assets (See Policy SE 10 'Sustainable Provision of Minerals').
13.51 In the council’s Green Space Strategy, the Open Space vision is to provide 'a network of
clean, green, sustainable, attractive, well maintained, safe areas for all ages, for formal and informal
recreational activities, more formal outdoor sports or for sitting and relaxing, which are easily accessible
and are well designed to avoid conflict and build community cohesion, whilst enhancing our day to
day environment'.

13.53 The combined open space standards would give a total figure of 2.6 hectares of open space
per 1,000 population plus developer contributions for outdoor sports provision – either enhancement
of existing sites or towards the provision of new facilities. In some cases, commuted sums generally
may be more appropriate for improvement of other open spaces and green infrastructure connectivity.
2
The requirement per family dwelling would therefore range from 40m per home comprising children’s
2
play and amenity green space – to 65m per home comprising children’s play, amenity, allotments
and green connectivity plus a developer contribution for outdoor sports - in areas with severe shortages
2
in open space. It is likely that the total amount of 65m per home (plus developer contributions for
outdoor sports) would be required on major greenfield and brownfield development sites, though the
amount required would be influenced by other available evidence at that time. The Open Space
Standards Table below shows the open space requirement per home and also shows the equivalent
figure in hectares (per 1,000 population) that is used to assess the amount of open space in a particular
neighbourhood / community.
13.54 In some cases, commuted sums may be required for biodiversity offsetting/compensatory
habitat expansion. Developments should incorporate biodiversity considerations in their design but
there is still likely to be some biodiversity loss. One way to compensate for this loss is by offsetting:
this includes the provision of compensatory habitat expansion or restoration on an alternative site.

13.56 Viability considerations will be taken into account with any development proposal especially
when applying open space standards.
13.57 Paragraphs 76 and 77 of the National Planning Policy Framework consider Local Green
Space designations: “Local communities through local and neighbourhood plans should be able to
identify for special protection green areas of particular importance to them. By designating land as
Local Green Space local communities will be able to rule out new development other than in very
special circumstances. Identifying land as Local Green Space should therefore be consistent with
the local planning of sustainable development and complement investment in sufficient homes, jobs
and other essential services. Local Green Spaces should only be designated when a plan is prepared
or reviewed, and be capable of enduring beyond the end of the plan period”. Paragraph 77 sets out
when they might not be appropriate: “The Local Green Space designation will not be appropriate for
most green areas or open space. The designation should only be used:
where the green space is in reasonably close proximity to the community it serves;
where the green area is demonstrably special to a local community and holds a particular local
significance, for example because of its beauty, historic significance, recreational value (including
as a playing field), tranquillity or richness of its wildlife; and
where the green area concerned is local in character and is not an extensive tract of land."

Historic Environment
13.58 Our historic environment is a finite resource and an integral part of the unique character and
distinctiveness of Cheshire East. In essence, it helps shape our distinctive identity and contributes
significantly to both the landscape and townscape qualities of the borough.
13.59 Cheshire East's historic environment includes both visible and below ground archaeological
heritage assets. Built heritage is not solely about physical or architectural character, but just as
importantly, the technological, social and cultural significance of a building, feature or place, both to
our community, but also to the nation as a whole. It is also important to maintain the integrity and
setting of designated and un-designated heritage assets and the features they contain. Many of these
heritage assets are vulnerable to change and are under pressure. Once damaged or removed, they

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

are irreplaceable, to the detriment of both current and future generations. Consequently, it is important
to the long term well-being of the borough that there is positive stewardship of its built heritage and
that its conservation and management are key priorities in the future place-shaping of Cheshire East.
13.60 The council is committed to conserving the historic significance of the borough’s heritage
assets, their setting and the wider historic environment. Cheshire East’s heritage is an essential
component of its present and its future. A critical component to achieving a high-quality built
environment is to ensure that the borough’s historic environment is sustainably managed, enhanced
and protected, whilst supporting appropriate, sustainable development.
13.61 Once lost or altered, features of the historic environment cannot be replaced. It is important
therefore that decision making is based on a full understanding of the significance of heritage assets
affected by development, the impacts arising from those proposals and the wider public benefit arising
from the proposed development.

Policy SE 7
The Historic Environment

2.

3.

Cheshire East has an extensive and varied built heritage and historic environment, described
in the justification text to this policy. The character, quality and diversity of the historic
environment will be conserved and enhanced. All new development should seek to avoid
harm to heritage assets and make a positive contribution to the character of Cheshire East's
historic and built environment, including the setting of assets and where appropriate, the
wider historic environment.
Proposals for development shall be assessed and the historic built environment actively
managed in order to contribute to the significance of heritage assets and local distinctiveness.
Where a development proposal is likely to affect a designated heritage asset (including its
setting) the significance of the heritage asset, including any contribution made by its setting,
must be described and reported as part of the application.
The council will support development proposals that do not cause harm to, or which better
reveal the significance of heritage assets and will seek to avoid or minimise conflict between
the conservation of a heritage asset and any aspect of a development proposal by:

Requiring that the impact of a proposal on the significance of a non-designated
heritage asset should be properly considered, as these are often equally valued
by local communities. There should be a balanced consideration, weighing the
direct and indirect impacts upon the asset and its setting, having regard to the
scale of any harm or loss. The presumption should be that heritage assets should
be retained and re-used wherever practicable and proposals that cannot
demonstrate that the harm will be outweighed by the benefits of the development
shall not be supported. Where loss or harm is outweighed by the benefits of
development, appropriate mitigation and compensation measures will be required
to ensure that there is no net loss of heritage value

For all heritage assets, high quality design should be achieved. It should aim to avoid poorly
executed pastiche design solutions and should foster innovation and creativity that is
sensitive and enhances the significance of heritage assets in terms of architectural design,
detailing, scale, massing and use of materials.
Cheshire East Council will seek to positively manage the historic built environment through
engagement with landowners/asset owners and other organisations and by working with
communities to ensure that heritage assets are protected, have appropriate viable uses,
are maintained to a high standard and are secured and have a sustainable future for the
benefit of future generations. Proposals that conserve and enhance assets on the Heritage
at Risk register will be encouraged.

Justification
13.62 The National Planning Policy Framework states that "local planning authorities should set
out in their Local Plan a positive strategy for the conservation and enjoyment of the historic
environment, including heritage assets most at risk through neglect, decay or other threats. In doing
so, they should recognise that heritage assets are an irreplaceable resource and conserve them in
a manner appropriate to their significance".

Sustainable Environment

13.63 Cheshire East contains a much valued, varied and unique built heritage. This is a key
contributor to the quality of life and economic attractiveness of the borough and has a positive and
important role to play in achieving a sustainable community in Cheshire East. The council will expect
new developments to respect and promote the distinctive local heritage of the area, including the
historic silk industry in Macclesfield, the importance of the rail industry in Crewe and the distinctive
qualities of towns and villages across the borough.

140

13.64 Key assets include Macclesfield's silk and industrial heritage, Little Moreton Hall, Crewe's
railway heritage, Tatton Park, Lyme Park, Quarry Bank Mill, Tegg's Nose Country Park, the canal
network, historic towns and parts of the Peak District National Park, amongst others. Specific unique
attractions include a wealth of historic parks and gardens and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank.
The area's stately homes and historic parks and gardens are a particular feature of Cheshire East
and pose particular challenges as well as opportunities. There are 76 conservation areas and 2,638
listed buildings including 47 grade 1 and 179 grade 2* listed buildings.
13.65 There is also a wealth of locally important heritage assets that are not formally designated,
but which are equally valued and cherished by local communities, ranging from smaller assets such
as boundary markers and railings, to larger buildings and structures, and historic landscapes, veteran
trees and ancient woodlands. Much of this local heritage remains unrecorded and therefore it is
essential that the impact of proposals upon these non-designated assets is also properly considered
in assessing development proposals. The council is, therefore, committed to protecting buildings,

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

structures, townscape features of particular local interest and value, and cherished landmarks, which
are not statutorily designated, including historic parklands.
13.66 The borough also has a rich archaeological resource ranging from the prehistoric period to
the Second World War, including sites such as the Bridestones Neolithic chambered tomb, the Roman
and medieval saltworking remains of Middlewich, the Roman and waterlogged deposits of Nantwich
the Saxon Sandbach Crosses, the site of the Civil War Battle of Nantwich and the defences of the
former airfield at Cranage. It also has a diverse historic landscape character, ranging from medieval
th
field systems to 20 Century fieldscapes.
13.67 In order to properly understand the nature, significance and physical extent of assets of
archaeological interest, programmes of mitigation in the form of desk-based assessment, field
evaluation, recording of the asset, minimising the impact through design modification, may be required.
Retaining as much as possible of the character of surviving historic landscapes can enhance the
local distinctiveness and attractiveness of new development.
13.68 Designated heritage assets are those that are recognised as having national heritage
significance and/or benefiting from statutory protection and comprise:
Conservation areas
Listed buildings
Scheduled monuments
Registered parks and gardens
Registered battlefields
World Heritage Sites
13.69
Non-designated heritage assets are locally important heritage assets which often have a
strong local affinity or association and comprise:
Areas of archaeological interest (including areas of archaeological potential and sites of
archaeological importance)
Buildings of local architectural or historic interest (local list)
Locally important assets not on the local list
Locally significant historic parks and gardens
Other locally important heritage landscapes

13.71 Design innovation will be positively encouraged to create architecture that is clearly of today
and the heritage of tomorrow, but which also marries with and responds to the wider historic context.
Whilst poor quality, ill considered pastiche design will be discouraged, architecture that focuses on
local traditions, character and craftsmanship will also be supported and encouraged. For both
contemporary and traditional design solutions, a focus on achieving quality, sense of place and local
distinctiveness will be essential in order to be supported in heritage sensitive contexts.
13.72 Cheshire East Council has a range of responsibilities and statutory powers to positively
manage the historic environment. In order to safeguard and maximise the gain from the borough’s
heritage assets, the council will seek to use these measures appropriately and responsibly for the
public benefit in order to conserve and enhance the borough’s historic environment. An increasingly
important issue for the historic environment is the harm arising from heritage crime. As part of the
management of the historic environment, the council will seek to work with local communities and
other partners to deliver the heritage crime programme in Cheshire East.
13.73 Monitoring and reviewing the status and condition of important heritage assets will be an
important activity, particularly where there are known development pressures and/or they are assets
being at risk, in particular on the Heritage at Risk Register.

13.70 Securing high quality design is very important to conserving, enhancing and enriching the
unique heritage and local identity of the borough. With respect to setting, and wider context, new
developments should respect the local character, massing, and scale of the area.

Renewable and Low Carbon Energy
13.75 The world's climate is in a period of warming. Scientists suggest "there is an overwhelming
scientific consensus that climate change is happening, and that it is primarily the result of human
(67)
activity,' mainly through the combustion of fossil fuels that result in the release of greenhouse gases
such as carbon dioxide.
13.76 Continued global warming will result in many changes to the environment, both locally and
internationally. Anticipated changes include 'average global temperatures [rising] by up to 6°C by the
end of this century. This is enough to make extreme weather events like floods and drought more
frequent and increase global instability, conflict, public health-related deaths and migration of people
to levels beyond any of our recent experience. Heat waves, droughts, and floods would affect the UK
(68)
too'.
13.77 The social, environmental and economic costs of climate change could be huge if no global
action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, international, European and national
legislation has been introduced to achieve a reduction of global carbon emissions in order to reduce
the cause and effect of climate change.
13.78 The UK legislation on carbon dioxide emissions is contained in the UK Climate Change Act
2008. This commits the UK to:
A 34% (potentially increasing to 42%) reduction of 1990 Carbon Dioxide levels by 2020
An 80% reduction of 1990 Carbon Dioxide levels by 2050

Sustainable Environment

13.79 The UK government has also committed to increasing the percentage of energy generated
from renewable resources. The Renewable Energy Directive 2009, states that 'by 2020, 15 per cent
of energy should be generated from renewable resources'.

142

13.80 In order for Cheshire East to contribute to the achievement of these objectives, there is a
need to introduce policies that encourage the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and encourage
the implementation of renewable and low carbon energy.

The development of renewable and low carbon energy schemes (including community-led
initiatives), together with any ancillary building(s) and infrastructure, will be positively
supported and considered in the context of sustainable development and any impact on
the landscape.
Weight will be given to the wider environmental, economic and social benefits arising from
renewable and low carbon energy schemes, whilst considering the anticipated adverse
impacts, individually and cumulatively upon:

recreation and access; and / or
The operation of air traffic, radar systems, electromagnetic transmissions, and the
Jodrell Bank Radio Telescope.

Appropriate mitigation measures to address any effects identified and considered (for all
low carbon and renewable schemes) will be required prior to any development proceeding.
Given the nature of some forms of renewable and low carbon energy schemes and their
supporting infrastructure and ancillary building(s), it will be necessary and appropriate in
certain instances, to secure removal of the scheme and its supporting infrastructure and
ancillary building(s) and restore the land to an appropriate use once a scheme is ready for
decommissioning, through the imposition of planning conditions.
Planning permission for wind energy development involving one or more wind turbines will
only be granted if:
i.

ii.

the development site is in an area identified as suitable for wind energy development
in the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document or Neighbourhood Plan;
and
following consultation, it can be demonstrated that the planning impacts identified by
affected local communities have been fully addressed and therefore the proposal has
their backing.

13.81 The National Planning Policy Framework states that the planning system should 'support
the transition to a low carbon future in a changing climate, taking full account of flood risk and coastal
change, and encourage the re-use of existing resources, including conversion of existing buildings,
and encourage the use of renewable resources (for example, by the development of renewable
energy)'. It also states that 'planning plays a key role in helping shape places to secure radical
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, minimising vulnerability and providing resilience to the
impacts of climate change, and supporting the delivery of renewable and low carbon energy and
associated infrastructure. This is central to the economic, social and environmental dimensions of
sustainable development'.
13.82 There are various sources of renewable and low carbon energy that can be applied in
Cheshire East. It is anticipated that the following technologies will be the most viable and feasible:

13.83 Renewable and low carbon energy has the potential to contribute to the borough’s electricity
supply. Assessments of technical and environmental constraints, as well as the potential landscape
and visual impact studies of renewable and low carbon energy development across the borough,
should be used to help identify suitable locations appropriate for renewable and low carbon energy
development.
13.84 Whilst the council’s evidence base studies makes reference to, and identify potential locations
suitable for renewable and low carbon technologies, this does not mean that technologies will
automatically be granted consent within the identified areas. Equally, it should not restrict development
for technologies (other than wind turbine development) outside of the identified areas, or mean that
technologies will automatically be refused consent if outside the identified areas.
13.85 Following the Written Ministerial Statement on 18th June 2015 and associated update to
Planning Practice Guidance, areas suitable for wind energy development will be formally identified
in the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document.

The council will look favourably upon development that follows the principles of the Energy
Hierarchy, and seeks to achieve a high rating under schemes such as BREEAM (for
non-residential development), CEEQUAL (for public-realm development) and Building for
Life. For non-residential development, this will be especially so where the standard attained
exceeds that required by the current Building Regulations (or as updated).
Non-residential development over 1,000 square metres will be expected to secure at least
10 per cent of its predicted energy requirements from decentralised and renewable or low
carbon sources, unless the applicant can clearly demonstrate that having regard to the type
of development and its design, this is not feasible or viable.
(69)
or within large scale
In those areas identified as 'District Heating Network Priority Areas'
development elsewhere, new development should contribute to the development of a
strategic district heating network, where feasible and viable, by seeking to make use of
available heat (including geothermal) and waste heat as follows:
i.

ii.

4.

5.
6.
7.

Large and mixed use developments of over 100 dwellings or non residential
development of 10,000 square metres gross floor space should install a site-wide
district heating network.
Smaller developments of 10 or more dwellings or non residential development of 1,000
square metres gross floor space should connect to any available district heating
network.

Where a district heating network does not yet exist, applicants should demonstrate that the
heating and cooling equipment installed is capable of connection to a network at a later
date.
New development should be designed to maximise the ability to accommodate a district
heating solution in terms of overall layout, phasing, mix of uses and density.
Development with high energy demands should give consideration to its potential role in
providing an anchor load for a district heating network.
In those areas that are not connected to the gas network, new development will be
encouraged to deliver its residual energy from low and zero carbon sources.

13.86 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'to support the move to a low carbon
future, local planning authorities should: plan for new development in locations and ways which reduce
greenhouse gas emissions; actively support energy efficiency improvements to existing buildings;
and when setting any local requirement for a building’s sustainability, do so in a way consistent with
the government’s zero carbon buildings policy and adopt nationally described standards'. It also states
that development should 'comply with adopted Local Plan policies on local requirements for
decentralised energy supply unless it can be demonstrated by the applicant, having regard to the
type of development involved and its design, that this is not feasible or viable; and take account of
landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping to minimise energy consumption'.

Figure 13.3 Energy Hierarchy

13.87 Cheshire East is relatively constrained in terms of its capacity to generate renewable energy,
particularly from large scale technologies. Consequently, achieving national and local targets to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions and increase renewable energy generation will be extremely
challenging. Without a requirement for efficiency standards that exceed the requirements of Building
Regulations on large sites, it would be unlikely to occur.
13.88 Cheshire East Council and Housing Associations will lead by example by seeking to maximise
energy efficiency and by incorporating renewable energy generation through the refurbishment and
redevelopment of land and buildings in their ownership.
13.89 This justification for the on-site low carbon energy target is drawn from the Cheshire East
‘Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Planning Research’ February 2011’, which considers
technical feasibility and financial viability. This approach is justified by the particular challenges and
characteristics of the borough. The target seeks to achieve a balance between the social, economic
and environmental imperative of higher standards and the commercial realities of property developers.
The council recognises that this will in some cases remain a challenging target, particularly for certain
building types, and so it will be acceptable to achieve average compliance across all buildings in a
development.

Sustainable Environment

13.90 Compliance with this requirement should be demonstrated through completion of the Standard
Assessment Procedure (SAP) which assesses the energy rating of development. This process is
already required to demonstrate compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations. If viability is
uncertain, applicants should use open book accounting to allow the determination of viability.

146

13.91 The purpose of the ‘district heating network priority areas’ is to prioritise district heating in
areas where the potential is greatest and to take advantage of available heat sources such as
geothermal or waste heat. The development of District Heating Networks to serve strategic
developments and areas where there are major energy users are being explored. However, it is
recognised that delivering District Heating Networks cannot be achieved though planning alone. The
aim of this policy is to ensure that new development makes an appropriate contribution.
13.92 The design and layout of site-wide networks should be such as to enable future expansion
into surrounding communities. Where appropriate, applicants may be required to provide land, buildings
and/or equipment for an energy centre to serve existing or new development, irrespective of whether
the scheme is currently in operation.
13.93 The viability of district heating schemes is heavily influenced by a development’s density,
mix of use, layout and phasing. Residential development should normally be at least 55 dwellings
per hectare and a minimum size of 100 homes. Mixed use development can allow densities to be
lower and can provide a good ‘anchor’ development (i.e. provides a high and stable heat load over
the day and year). The cost of district heating pipes is high and so the layout of a development should

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

seek to minimise the length of pipe needed. The on-site network should consider how it can be
connected to a strategic network in future.
13.94 The council is committed to encouraging households and businesses located in areas off
the gas network to move away from heating systems powered by liquid gas, oil or electricity towards
low and zero carbon technologies. Applications for new development in areas off the gas network
will be expected to comply with this requirement. This will have economic benefits for the occupants
as well as contributing to the achievement of national and local carbon dioxide and renewable energy
targets.
13.95 Government targets in relation to greenhouse gas reduction are recognised to be challenging.
Government and industry experts recognise that construction practice may be unable to keep pace
with the ambitious targets imposed and from this the notion of 'Allowable Solutions' was created.
These 'Allowable Solutions' are a way of providing flexibility for low and zero carbon development
and are likely to be an identified set of on, off and near-site options or projects that will be used to
offset the remaining greenhouse gas emissions of a proposal.
13.96 The proposed framework for zero carbon buildings policy including allowable solutions has
yet to be fully confirmed by government and is currently being developed at the national level. Cheshire
East Council will align with the national prescribed scheme, once in place, or look to establish local
mechanisms if the national scheme is not introduced as planned, to improve the viability of development
under the zero carbon requirements. Money raised through allowable solutions, or its locally established
alternative, will contribute towards the delivery of energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction
priorities identified by Cheshire East Council. Further guidance on this will be given at site allocations
stage following further national guidance on this matter expected from the government.

Make appropriate provision for the supply of aggregates having regard to Cheshire East’s
apportionment of sub-national supply guidelines and Local Aggregate Assessments.
Seek to maintain aggregate landbanks of at least 7 years sand and gravel and at least 10
years crushed rock supply over the plan period.
Make appropriate provision for the supply of permitted silica sand reserves at each site
equivalent to at least 10 years production throughout the plan period, or at least 15 years
at sites where significant new investment is required.
Identify suitable locations for potential sand and gravel, silica sand and salt extraction in
the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document. These will take the form of specific
sites, preferred areas and/or areas of search where appropriate.
Encourage and support the provision and use of suitable alternative materials to land-won
minerals in order to minimise the need for new primary extraction and conserve finite natural
resources.
Safeguard Cheshire East’s important mineral resources of silica sand, sand and gravel,
sandstone (including building stone), salt and surface coal through the definition of Mineral
Safeguarding Areas, which will be defined in the Site Allocations and Development Policies
Document and will include environmental designations, urban areas and buffer zones, plus
development management criteria. Within these areas, mineral resources will be protected
from unnecessary sterilisation by other development.
Safeguard existing and potential minerals associated infrastructure against other
development in close proximity which may potentially constrain its current or future use.
Support the extraction of natural building and roofing stone needed for architectural and
heritage purposes where environmentally acceptable.
Not support proposals for peat extraction from new or extended sites.
Encourage and support the transportation of minerals by alternative methods to road where
practicable.
Secure at the earliest opportunity the high standard restoration and aftercare of sites following
mineral working, recognising the diversity of appropriate restoration schemes to deliver the
potential for beneficial afteruses.
Recognise the need for the afteruse of underground salt cavities for gas storage purposes
in response to national energy policy.
Set out environmental criteria in the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document
against which all minerals proposals will be assessed to ensure operations do not have
unacceptable adverse impacts on the natural and historic environment or on human health.

Justification
13.98 Aggregates are the essential raw material needed in almost any construction activity such
as new housing and infrastructure. Cheshire East is a producer of sand and gravel and, to a small
scale, crushed rock (sandstone) used for aggregate purposes. To meet the future demand for
aggregates, supply levels set out in National and Sub-National Aggregate Guidelines have been
apportioned between the Mineral Planning Authorities of the North West through agreement between

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

13.99 Levels of aggregate supply to meet demand will be reviewed when necessary following the
publication of updated National and Sub-National Aggregate Guidelines. Local Aggregate Assessments
(LAAs) will also be prepared annually to assess the supply and demand of aggregates in Cheshire
East based on 10-year sales averages and other relevant information, identifying if any shortfall or
surplus exists.
13.100 In order to provide security of aggregate supply, provision should be made to maintain
minimum aggregate landbanks of at least 7 years sand and gravel and at least 10 years crushed
rock supply throughout the plan period. Landbanks will be used to monitor the security of aggregate
supply from Cheshire East, indicating if a review of provision is needed, and as a consideration when
assessing the need for new planning permissions.
13.101 Our evidence base tells us that there is a sufficient crushed rock aggregate landbank across
permitted sites, but that additional sand and gravel reserves will be required within the period up to
2030 in order to maintain a landbank consistent with national policy. Provision for sand and gravel
supply in Cheshire East will be made through the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document.

5.59mt sand and gravel, 4.29mt crushed rock as of 31 December 2012.
7 years sand and gravel, 10 years crushed rock.
As detailed in NWAWP (2011) 'Sub-regional apportionment of 2005-2020 guidelines for aggregate provision in the

prepared for Cheshire West and Chester and Cheshire East Councils'.
Calculations will be based on the average of the previous 10 years’ sales and will have regard to the use and quality
of the material (Paragraph 90, Planning Practice Guidance).

Sustainable Environment

13.102 Silica sand resources in Cheshire East are recognised as being of national economic
importance. In response to national planning policy, the Authority is, therefore, required to ensure
that a steady and adequate supply of this raw material is provided. Due to the national need for silica
sand, it is important that each production site is adequately provided for, unless exceptional
circumstances prevail. Therefore a minimum stock of permitted reserves for at least 10 years
production should be maintained at individual sites throughout the plan period, or for at least 15 years
(74)
at new or existing sites where significant new capital investment is required . Silica sand quarries
in Cheshire East also produce quantities of sand for sold aggregate purposes and, therefore, contribute
to the overall supply and landbank of aggregate sand and gravel.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

149

13.103 To enable the provision of a steady and adequate supply of both aggregate and industrial
minerals, allocations in the form of specific sites, preferred areas and/or an area of search for potential
future minerals development will be identified through the Site Allocations and Development Policies
Document. This approach to allocations is considered to offer a level of certainty as to where potential
mineral extraction may take place, whilst providing a degree of flexibility to meet needs over the plan
period. This will involve reviewing existing allocations in the Cheshire Replacement Minerals Local
Plan 1999. New allocations will be subject to necessary environmental assessment and sustainability
73

appraisal. New sites, or extensions to existing sites for future peat extraction, will not be included
consistent with national planning policy.
13.104 The consumption of primary (land-won) mineral resources can be offset by alternative
materials such as secondary or recycled aggregates produced as industrial by-products or from
construction, demolition and excavation (CD&E) waste. Whilst it is acknowledged not all primary
minerals can feasibly be replaced, proposals offering to provide suitable alternative materials in
appropriate locations should be supported in order to limit the need for land-won extraction and help
to secure the long term conservation of finite natural resources. The Minerals and Waste DPD will
identify appropriate sites needed for the management of CD&E waste, including for aggregate
recycling.
13.105 As mineral resources are finite and can only be worked where they naturally occur, in
accordance with the principles of sustainable development, they should be safeguarded in order to
meet the needs of future generations. Mineral resources considered for safeguarding in Cheshire
East for their economic importance include:
Silica (industrial) sand,
Sand and gravel
Sandstone (including for building stone purposes)
Salt
Surface coal

Sustainable Environment

13.106 The broad extent of these resources is shown on the Mineral Resources in Cheshire East
map (Figure 13.4). This is based on mineral resource data provided by the BGS and The Coal
Authority. This data will provide the basis for the definition of Mineral Safeguarding Areas (MSAs)
in the Minerals ands Waste DPD, subject to refinement through consultation with the minerals industry
and others.

150

Figure 13.4 Mineral Resources in Cheshire East (based on BGS/Coal Authority data)

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

13.107 The purpose of MSAs is to prevent the needless sterilisation of mineral resources by alerting
to their presence. This factor can then be given appropriate consideration in the planning process.
MSAs do not preclude other (non-mineral) forms of development being permitted within them, nor
do they carry any presumption that the mineral resource will be worked. Where it can be demonstrated
that it is environmentally feasible and practicable, the prior extraction of the mineral resource will be
encouraged ahead of necessary development.
13.108 Prior extraction is the process by which a mineral is won from a site prior to non-mineral
development taking place. This can take place at a number of different scales, which would depend
on the size of the site, the depth of mineral, the type and quality of the mineral, and the nature of the
proposed development. In line with the requirements of the NPPF, the Minerals and Waste DPD will
set out policies to encourage the prior extraction of minerals, where practicable and environmentally
feasible, if it is necessary for non-mineral development to take place.
13.109 In safeguarding sites for existing, planned and potential minerals associated infrastructure
(as set out in the NPPF), including for secondary and recycled materials, appropriate consideration
will also be given to the potential constraints that proximal (non-mineral) development may place on
the operation of this infrastructure.
13.110 Cheshire East will work with the minerals industry and others to ensure that MSAs are
based upon the best available information and that all relevant mineral associated infrastructure has
been considered. Accompanying policy will be set out in the Minerals and Waste DPD to support
the practical implementation of determining proposals in these areas in line with best practice
(75)
guidance .
13.111 Cheshire East has a valued, varied and unique built heritage. The provision of locally-sourced
building and roofing stone is therefore important to enable the repair and maintenance of built heritage
assets in support of their long term conservation as well as ensuring sensitivity of design in proximity
to designated and local heritage assets and their settings This complements the aims of Policy SE
1 ‘Design’ and Policy SE 7 ‘The Historic Environment'.
13.112 Proposals for the extraction of peat at new or extended sites in Cheshire East, will not be
supported, reflecting the national planning policy position on peat extraction.

13.114 Mineral working is a temporary use of land, although it often takes place over long periods
of time. The restoration and subsequent aftercare of mineral sites following the completion of extraction
can provide opportunities to deliver a range of sustainable, positive and beneficial after-uses. This
includes agriculture, forestry/native woodland, nature conservation, amenity and recreation. Restored
land can also help adapt to or mitigate the effects of climate change and contribute to Cheshire East’s
network of green infrastructure, consistent with Policy SE 6 ‘Green Infrastructure’. The most
appropriate restoration schemes to deliver the potential for beneficial afteruses will be determined
on a site-by-site basis.
13.115 Local geological circumstances in Cheshire East have demonstrated their feasibility for
natural gas storage purposes in underground cavities, created following the extraction of salt (in brine)
with the suggested potential for carbon storage. In response to national planning policy,
encouragement should be given to such afteruse, subject to ensuring that the appropriate integrity
and safety measures are satisfactorily secured. Government has identified the need for gas storage
capacity to contribute to national energy security.

transportation of minerals with alternative methods such as rail, waterway, pipeline or conveyor.
Whilst it is recognised that given the nature of mineral extraction in Cheshire East, road often presents
the only feasible option, alternative methods will be encouraged and supported wherever this is
practicable.

For all mineral development, it is essential that operations do not give rise to any
unacceptable adverse impacts on the natural and historic environment or on human health. In addition
to the relevant polices in this plan, detailed policies will be brought forward through the Minerals and

collected (including household); commercial and industrial; construction, excavation and demolition;
and hazardous. Waste management has changed significantly over the last twenty years in the UK
with a major decrease in waste being disposed of to landfill and an increase in recycling - a trend
experienced in Cheshire and Cheshire East. New technologies are also emerging to manage waste
as a resource offering benefits such as energy generation.
(76)

Sustainable Environment

13.118 A key aim of the government is to move towards a 'zero waste economy'
in which material
resources are re-used, recycled or recovered wherever possible, and only disposed of as the last
option. To achieve this, waste must be managed according to the principles of the 'Waste Hierarchy'.

As set out in: DEFRA (2011) 'Government Review of Waste Policy in England 2011'.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Policy SE 11
Sustainable Management of Waste
To achieve the sustainable management of waste in Cheshire East, the council will:
1.

2.

Expect all proposals for waste management development to maximise opportunities for
waste to be managed in accordance with the principles of the Waste Hierarchy whereby
priority will be given, in order, to its (i) prevention; (ii) preparation for re-use; (iii) recycling;
(iv) other recovery; and (v) disposal.
Meet the predicted needs of Cheshire East through provision of sufficient opportunities for
waste management facilities in appropriate locations, including for waste disposal. This
will be achieved through the preparation of a Waste Development Plan Document (DPD).
This plan will:
i.
ii.
iii.

Identify sites and areas suitable for new or enhanced waste management facilities for
(77)
the identified waste management needs of Cheshire East
over the plan period.
Integrate with Cheshire East’s municipal waste management strategy.
Set out policies to ensure that proposals for the management of waste do not endanger
human health or cause environmental harm.

Justification
13.119 A key objective of sustainable development is to produce less waste and wherever possible
use it as a resource. To deliver this, the management of waste must be driven up the ‘Waste
(78)
Hierarchy’ whereby options for management are prioritised in order according to their environmental
impact. The most sustainable and environmentally friendly option is to reduce the amount of waste
that is produced in the first place. When waste is created, priority is then given to preparing it for
re-use, then to recycling (including composting), then to recovery (including energy generation), and
last of all disposal (for example landfill).
13.120 Specific policies and the allocation of sites for waste development in Cheshire East will be
set out in the Minerals and Waste DPD. This will be prepared with regard to the Waste Management
(79)
Plan for England and in consistency with national waste planning policy . Production of the Waste
DPD will follow the timetable outlined in the Local Development Scheme (LDS) to ensure the timely
provision of new facilities.

Including parts of the Borough in the Peak District National Park.
A legislative requirement under Article 4 of the revised EU Waste Framework (Directive 2008/98/EC) transposed
through the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011.
The National Planning Policy Framework does not contain specific waste policies. Updated national waste planning
policy has been published as part of the Waste Management Plan for England replacing the existing national waste
planning policy contained in Planning Policy Statement 10 (PPS10): Planning for Sustainable Waste Management.

Sustainable Environment

13.121 The Minerals and Waste DPD will identify and address the waste management needs of
Cheshire East and plan for appropriate provision based on analysis of the best available waste data
and appraisal of options. This will be based upon updated evidence on the authority's waste arisings
(for all waste streams), its management capacity and on cross boundary waste flows both into and
out of the authority area.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

153

13.122 Sites and areas in the borough suitable for new or enhanced waste management facilities
will be identified consistent with criteria set out in national waste planning policy and, if necessary,
safeguarded for this use. Recognition will be given to the benefits of co-locating waste management
facilities and the potential for new technologies that use waste as a resource to help drive its
management up the Waste Hierarchy.
77
78
79

13.123 The Minerals and Waste DPD will also integrate with the council’s municipal waste strategy
to ensure Cheshire East's waste is managed in the most sustainable way, reducing reliance on landfill.
13.124 Policy will be set to ensure that the environment and human health is protected through
the prevention or mitigation of the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste,
complementing other relevant policies in the Local Plan.
13.125 It is recognised that waste management is strategic in nature and that movements of
materials cross administrative boundaries. Preparation of the Minerals and Waste DPD will involve
engaging with other relevant Waste Planning Authorities to address any issues of cross boundary
waste movements based on the evidence available.

Pollution
13.126 The Local Plan plays a key role in determining the location of development that may give
rise to pollution, either directly or indirectly, and in ensuring that other uses and development are not,
as far as possible, affected by major existing or potential sources of pollution. Development should
avoid and, if necessary, mitigate against environmental impacts.

Pollution, Land Contamination and Land Instability

5.

The council will seek to ensure all development is located and designed so as not to result
in a harmful or cumulative impact upon air quality, surface water and groundwater, noise,
smell, dust, vibration, soil contamination, light pollution or any other pollution which would
unacceptably affect the natural and built environment, or detrimentally affect amenity or
cause harm. Developers will be expected to minimise, and mitigate the effects of possible
pollution arising from the development itself, or as a result of the development (including
additional traffic) during both the construction and the life of the development. Where
adequate mitigation cannot be provided, development will not normally be permitted.
Development for new housing or other environmentally sensitive development will not
normally be permitted where existing air pollution, soil contamination, noise, smell, dust,
vibration, light or other pollution levels are unacceptable and there is no reasonable prospect
that these can be mitigated against.
Development should support improvements to air quality, not contradict the Air Quality
Strategy or Air Quality Action Plan and seek to promote sustainable transport policies.
Where a proposal may affect or be affected by contamination or land instability (including
natural dissolution and/or brine pumping related subsidence), at the planning application
stage, developers will be required to provide a report which investigates the extent of the
contamination or stability issues and the possible affect it may have on the development
and its future users, the natural and built environment. This report should be written in line
with best practice guidance.
In most cases, development will only be deemed acceptable where it can be demonstrated
that any contamination or land instability issues can be appropriately mitigated against and
remediated, if necessary.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Justification
13.127 The National Planning Policy Framework states that the planning system should 'prevent
both new and existing development from contributing to or being put at unacceptable risk from, or
being adversely affected by unacceptable levels of soil, air, water or noise pollution or land instability';
as well as ‘remediating and mitigating despoiled, degraded, derelict, contaminated and unstable land,
where appropriate’
13.128 The council strongly supports the need to protect the environment and residents from the
effects of pollution. Some types of development may cause or contribute to air quality, water or land
pollution. The council will therefore seek to make sure that levels are kept to a minimum through the
construction phase and life of the development, and are not detrimental to human health, the
environment or the amenity of neighbouring or nearby users, or the users of the development itself.
13.129 Paragraph 124 of the NPPF requires that planning policies should sustain compliance with,
and contribute towards, EU Limit values or national objectives for pollutants, taking account of the
presence of Air Quality Management Areas and the cumulative impacts on air quality for individual
sites in local areas. Planning decisions should ensure new development in (or which may affect) an
Air Quality Management Area is consistent with the current Cheshire East Air Quality Action Plan.
13.130 One approach to dealing with the cumulative impact of developments is through the
preparation of a low emissions strategy designed to accelerate the uptake of low emissions fuels and
technologies in and around development sites. Cheshire East Council is currently in the process of
producing a low emission strategy for the borough.
13.131 Noise and vibration can lead to harm or be detrimental to amenity. Whilst planning cannot
control the noise or vibration from existing established development, it can try to ensure that new
noise sensitive development is not close to existing sources which generate noise, such as industrial
uses, noise created by vehicles and other forms of transport or even evening uses such as hot food
takeaways. This policy will seek to ensure development is planned appropriately, so new developments
which have the potential to create noise are not located in places where they would unacceptably
affect the natural and built environment, or detrimentally affect amenity or cause harm.
13.132 Noise and vibration during the construction process can often cause disturbance and
detrimentally affect amenity to occupants of neighbouring properties. The council will, where necessary,
seek to attach planning conditions assessing each case on its individual merits.

13.135 Contamination is not always restricted to previously developed land, it can be located on
greenfield land and can arise from natural sources as well as from human activities. Development
on land which is known or suspected to be contaminated, or for uses which would be particularly
vulnerable in terms of exposure to contamination (such as housing or schools), must be supported
by sufficient information to enable the possible contamination risks to be fully assessed. It is essential
that measures are then put in place which allows the development to go ahead safely.

Sustainable Environment

13.133 Lighting is an important part of ‘everyday life’ as it can be used to improve the appearance
and character of an area/building, as a security feature and a way in which uses can be extended for
longer periods of time (into the evening hours) thereby causing potential noise issues. The council
is aware of the increasing issues arising from artificial lighting, which can often impact upon residential
amenity, the character and appearance of an area (particularly rural locations) and the environment.
Aspects such as poor design, location, the expel of unnecessarily high levels of light can have a
harmful impact. In addition, lighting left on unnecessarily is a waste of energy.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

155

13.134 Whilst not all forms of lighting require planning permission, the council will, where appropriate,
seek to influence light pollution that would have a harmful impact upon the natural/built environment
and amenity.

13.136 Natural conditions such as landslides (due to geology, angle of land), soluble rocks or
(80)
mining activities such as coal mining or subsidence caused by brine pumping
can cause land
instability. Guidance on areas affected by brine pumping is available as part of the pre-application
advice process (generally, this issue affects Middlewich, Sandbach and North Cheshire). Specific
conditions may need to be applied to address the impact of ground instability in these areas.
Development on land which would be affected by, or would affect land stability must therefore be
accompanied by a report which identifies the risk. Development on land where instability cannot be
mitigated and remediated will not normally be allowed.
13.137 The council will seek the advice of the appropriate regulatory/statutory organisations including
the Environment Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Manchester Airport, The Coal Authority and
The Cheshire Brine Subsidence Compensation Board on proposals falling within defined consultation
zones. There are a number of installations and pipelines in the borough handling notifiable substances
and the Proposals Map will indicate consultation zones appropriate to their uses.
13.138
Further guidance on the above will be provided in subsequent planning policy or
Supplementary Planning Documents.

Flood Risk and Water Management
13.139 In recent years, floods have shown how vulnerable the UK is to extreme weather events,
resulting in significant economic, social and environmental cost. Whilst Cheshire East may not have
experienced devastating fluvial or surface water flood events as seen in 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2014,
the number and severity of recent floods seems to be on the increase and climate change means
that the frequency, pattern and severity of flooding are expected to increase.

Sustainable Environment

13.140
Effective land use management has become one of the most important ways to manage
flood risks and improve community resilience. Sustainable development in the right locations can
help reduce the quantity of water entering our river and drainage networks, improve water quality
within the borough and provide opportunities to enhance biodiversity, health and recreation.

156

13.141 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and its supporting Technical Guidance
sets out the approach that Local Planning Authorities and developers should follow in considering
flood risk, including a hierarchy of flood risk assessment documents.
13.142 Cheshire East Council as a local planning authority is required to undertake a Strategic
Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) to identify areas at risk of flooding from all sources. For Cheshire
East, this is flooding from rivers (fluvial), canals and reservoirs, groundwater, surface water and
sewers, and the implications of climate change. The SFRA will then in turn inform the Local Plan
Strategy.

80

There is a statutory duty under the Cheshire Brine Pumping (Compensation for Subsidence) Act, 1952 to consult
with the Cheshire Brine Subsidence Compensation Board for all development within certain prescribed consultation
areas.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Policy SE 13
Flood Risk and Water Management
Developments must integrate measures for sustainable water management to reduce flood risk,
avoid an adverse impact on water quality and quantity within the borough and provide opportunities
to enhance biodiversity, health and recreation, in line with national guidance, by ensuring that:

7.

All development follows the sequential approach to determining the suitability of land for
development, direct new development to areas at lowest risk of flooding and where necessary
apply the exception test; this should take into account all sources of flooding identified in
the Cheshire East SFRA.
All planning applications for development at risk of flooding are supported by an appropriate
Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) to demonstrate that development proposals will not increase
flood risk on site or elsewhere and opportunities to reduce the risk of flooding are sought,
taking into account the impacts of Climate Change in line with the Cheshire East SFRA.
New development will be required to include or contribute to flood mitigation, compensation
and / or protection measures, where necessary, to manage flood risk associated with or
caused by the development.
New development is designed to be safe, taking into account the lifetime of the development,
and the need to adapt to climate change.
All developments, including changes to existing buildings, seeks improvements to the current
surface water drainage network and be designed to manage surface water. This should
include appropriate sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) and green infrastructure to store,
convey and treat surface water prior to discharge with the aim of achieving a reduction in
the existing runoff rate, but must not result in an increase in runoff. It is not sustainable to
dispose of surface water via the public sewer systems; applicants seeking to drain to the
public sewers must demonstrate there are no other more sustainable viable options. Where
appropriate, opportunities to open existing culverts should be identified.
Where water infrastructure capacity is an issue, all major development must demonstrate
that there is adequate infrastructure in place to serve the development.
New development enhances and protects surface and ground water quality and complies
with the Water Framework Directive in ensuring that development does not cause a
deterioration in the status of inland waters, unless suitable mitigation measures are in place;
and
New development incorporates water efficiency measures.

13.143 The Cheshire East area predominantly covers the Cheshire Plain, a flat, lowland area,
which is characterised by watercourses running in well-defined floodplains and localised areas of
hilly terrain. To the northeast, this includes part of the western Peak District, an upland area forming
the southern end of the Pennines. This area has steep topography, and is characterised by steep
sided valleys and large numbers of minor watercourses.
13.144
The main source of flood risk in Cheshire East is from main rivers and Ordinary
Watercourses. Whilst the overall level of risk from these sources is low, there are principal town
centres such as Crewe, Macclesfield and in Key Service Centres such as Congleton, where risk is
greater due to the presence of a densely urban population. In these urban areas, watercourses can
often be modified with straightened and culverted sections, especially where rivers flow underneath
major railway and road infrastructure.
13.145
Cheshire East Council (CEC) published the Cheshire East Level 1 Surface Water
Management Plan (SWMP) in July 2012. The SWMP project brought together existing flood risk

Justification

157

information from CEC, the Environment Agency and United Utilities to assess the surface water flood
risk across the study area, first through a strategic review of flood risk and then an assessment of
particular sites potentially at high risk from flooding. The strategic review of flood risk across the study
area has indicated that the overall level of surface water flood risk is moderate. In particular:
Due to the flat nature of the topography, there is likely to be extensive surface water flooding
resulting from an extreme rainfall event. This flooding is unlikely to be deep or fast flowing,
except in localised areas, and only small numbers of properties are likely to be affected.
Deep flooding is only likely to be experienced where there are localised low-points, such as
natural closed depressions, or man-made features, for example underground car parks or
subways.
In a small number of locations, steep topography is likely to result in surface water flooding along
well defined flow-paths. Flooding in these areas has the potential to represent a significant
hazard to people due to its velocity and depth.
There are likely to be a number of locations throughout the study area where surface water and
fluvial flooding mechanisms are likely to interact. In these areas, it may be difficult to identify
the exact source of any flooding, and CEC and the Environment Agency will have to work together
to manage these issues.
There are a large number of Ordinary Watercourses within the study area, some of which run
through urban areas. In many cases, these watercourses have been culverted over and are
likely to be in poor condition. A blockage or collapse of one of these culverts could represent a
significant flood risk to adjacent properties.
13.146 As a local planning authority, Cheshire East Council should use the flood risk evidence
collected through the SFRA and SWMP to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding
by directing development away from areas at highest risk, but where development is necessary,
making it safe without increasing flood risk elsewhere. This should be carried out through the planning
process, specifically during the development of the Local Plan.
13.147 The NPPF also states that Local Plans should 'take account of climate change over the
longer term, including factors such as flood risk, coastal change, water supply and changes to
biodiversity and landscape'.

Sustainable Environment

13.148 As a Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) the council has a number of roles and responsibilities
within local flood risk management as required under the Flood Risk Regulations 2009 and the Flood
and Water Management Act 2010.

158

13.149 The Flood Risk Regulations require the Council to develop a Preliminary Flood Risk
Assessment (PFRA). The Cheshire East PFRA was published in June 2011. The PFRA did not identify
a Flood Risk Area using the national significant thresholds set by Defra. As a result, the next stages
of the PFRA process, the requirement to develop flood risk hazard mapping and Flood Risk
Management Plans, do not apply to Cheshire East Council. However, the Environment Agency is
currently in the process of updating their national Flood Map for Surface Water (uFMfSW), which is
expected to meet the requirements for flood risk hazard mapping and will be available to Cheshire
East Council later in 2013.
13.150 Under the Flood and Water Management Act, Cheshire East, as the LLFA, has responsibility
for developing a Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS) for their area covering local sources
of flooding. The local strategy produced must be consistent with the national strategy. It will set out
the local organisations with responsibility for flood risk in the area, partnership arrangements to ensure
co-ordination between these, an assessment of the flood risk and plans and actions for managing
the risk. The strategy will outline how the council intends to deliver its remaining duties under the
Act. The council now has additional permissive powers of control over ordinary watercourses to help
manage flood risk across the borough (notably new regulatory duties under Land Drainage Act 1991
and any associated Byelaws currently being considered).
13.151 The Cheshire East LFRMS is currently being prepared and the findings of the Cheshire
East SFRA and the Cheshire East SWMP should help inform its development.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

13.152 Wider national policy contained within Catchment Flood Management Plans (CFMPs) and
River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) should also influence how flood risk is managed at a local
level.
13.153 A CFMP provides a detailed overview of flood risk from multiple sources and policies for
long-term management of flood risk within the catchment that take into account the likely impacts of
climate change, the effects of land use and land management, deliver multiple benefits and contribute
towards sustainable development. This is critical when areas under development pressure coincide
with high flood risk.
13.154
Chosen policies and actions can be used to influence the location of development.
Development should be focused towards the more 'sustainable' areas in terms of lower risk of flooding
or where flood risk management is considered viable within the short and long-term plans.
Development should be avoided in those areas where it is deemed inappropriate, to reduce flood
risk now and in the future. Therefore, development should not rely on the future policy direction, as
Environment Agency led Flood Risk Management infrastructure investment is not there to support
future development, but rather to protect current properties and people at risk. Where development
is planned in high risk areas, private (developer) funding will be required to reduce risk. In this
instance, development may not be viable. Cheshire East is located in two CFMP catchments; the
Upper Mersey and the Weaver Gowy.
13.155 The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to deliver improvements across Europe in the
management of water quality and water resources as well as improving the physical state of water
courses and improving in-channel habitat. The WFD requires all inland and coastal waters to reach
“good ecological status” by 2015 through a catchment-based system of River Basin Management
Plans (RBMPs). The Water Environment Regulations (2003) transposed the WFD into law in England
and Wales and the Environment Agency is leading on its delivery.
13.156 Cheshire East is within the North West River Basin District and the Environment Agency
published the final North West River Basin Management Plan in December 2009. The main
responsibility for the council is to work with the Environment Agency to develop links between river
basin management planning and the development of Local Authority plans, policies and assessments.
In particular, the programme of actions (measures) within the River Basin Management Plan highlights
the need for:
Water Cycle Strategies,
Considering the WFD objectives (achieving good status or potential as appropriate) in the spatial
planning process, including LDDs and Sustainable Community Strategies, and
Promoting the use of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in new development.

13.158 New development should incorporate water efficiency measures as much as is practicable.
Standards of water efficiency for residential and commercial development will be further defined at
Site Allocations and Development Policies stage.

Within the Peak District National Park Fringe
development that would affect the setting
of the Peak District National Park will be resisted where it compromises the statutory
designation and purposes of the National Park.
Development will be considered on its individual merits having particular regard to the type,
scale and location taking account of the Peak District National Park Landscape guidelines
and characteristics of the South West Peak and the adjoining areas of the Cheshire Plain.

2.

Justification
The Peak District National Park is an asset of national, regional, and local importance. It was the first
of 15 national parks in the United Kingdom to be designated for their spectacular landscapes, cultural
heritage and wildlife, and for people to enjoy.
13.164
as:

The Environment Act (1995) establishes the statutory purposes of national park designation,

to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the national parks;
and
to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities [of the
parks] by the public.
13.165 Section 62 of the Act places a general duty on all relevant authorities, statutory undertakers
and other public bodies, to have regard to these purposes.
13.166 Special Qualities define what is distinctive and significant about the Peak District compared
with other parts of the country. Understanding these qualities helps us to plan effectively and manage
the national park in order to protect them.
13.167 In the Peak District National Park Core Strategy, they are described as valued characteristics
and include:

Trees, woodlands, hedgerows, stone walls, field barns and other landscape features.
Significant geological features.
Wealth of historic buildings, parks and gardens.
Opportunities to experience tranquillity and quiet enjoyment.
Easy access for visitors and surrounding urban areas.
Opportunities to experience dark night skies.
Vibrancy and a sense of community.

Environmentally friendly methods of farming and working the land.
Craft and cottage industries.
Opportunities to improve physical and emotional well-being.
Special values attached to the national park by surrounding urban communities.
The flow of landscape character across and beyond the national park boundary.
13.168 The Peak District National Park is a complex tapestry of different landscapes in which there
are three distinct areas. The South West Peak sits along the boundary of the Peak Park Fringe but
also includes parts of this area in order to reflect the flow of landscape character (a feature which is
reflected in the list of special qualities above). It is particularly characterised by its sloping valleys
with woodlands which are described within the Peak District National Park Landscape strategy as:
'a pastoral landscape with a varied undulating topography of steep slopes, low ridges and incised
valleys. Blocks of woodland are a characteristic feature of this landscape, together with patches of
acid grassland and bracken on steeper slopes and higher ground. This is an area of traditional
dispersed settlement with probable ancient origins. Views to lower ground are framed by woodlands
and valley sides. This landscape covers extensive tracts of the western slopes of the South West
Peak, in the landscapes rising above Macclesfield and Leek.'
13.169 In places, the boundaries of the Peak District National Park follow administrative rather
than landscape boundaries. Through consultation, the council will seek to work with the Peak District
National Park to ensure that all new developments within the Peak District National Park Fringe will
not have an adverse impact upon the purposes of the Peak District National Park and its valued
characteristics, having particular regard to the type and scale of the development and the Peak District
National Park Landscape Assessment and Strategy.

that facilitates the use of sustainable modes of transport, locate significant trip generating development
where the need to travel is minimised and promote a mix of uses within walking distance of homes.
14.2 The targets for housing and employment growth in the borough further strengthen the need
for adequate supporting infrastructure including the provision of new transport infrastructure, measures
to restrain car use and increase use of public transport, cycling and walking as well as other
improvements.
14.3 The relationship between Local Transport Plans and the Local Plan Strategy is crucial to
implementing the objective of managing transport demand and promoting accessibility and integration,
both across Cheshire East and with neighbouring areas. The Local Plan Strategy aims to capitalise
on the strengths of the existing transport system in Cheshire East, including good transport links to
major centres by way of the rail and motorway network. It sets out how we will seek to improve
connectivity in the future.
14.4 The scale of development proposed will require significant investment in transport infrastructure
and a step change in the provision of public transport and other sustainable modes. The economic
strength of Cheshire East, and the quality of life on offer, very much depend on the accessibility,
speed, quality and cost of transport facilities. Therefore, increasing accessibility and promoting
sustainable travel is a key theme within the Local Plan Strategy.
14.5 We must also be realistic about the challenges we face. The way we travel is changing to
adapt to climate change and new technologies, the age profile of the population and shifts in the
global economy.
14.6 Good transport links are crucial for a successful economy, thriving towns and rural areas and
a good quality of life for all our residents. We want to make sure that our transport system enables
people to safely get to the places they want to, when they want to, that people can walk and cycle
as a real alternative to the car and that our transport system is integrated across all modes of transport.

Sustainable Travel and Transport
14.7 The challenge for the Local Plan Strategy is twofold; to redress shortfalls in infrastructure and
improve connectivity to support economic growth, whilst changing the need for travel and the way
we travel, by promoting new and sustainable options.

Policy CO 1
Sustainable Travel and Transport
To deliver the council objectives of delivering a safe, sustainable, high quality, integrated transport
system that encourages a modal shift away from car travel to public transport, cycling and walking;
supportive of the needs of residents and businesses and preparing for carbon free modes of
transport, the council will expect development to:

Justification
14.8 The National Planning Policy Framework states that "transport policies have an important role
to play in facilitating sustainable development but also in contributing to wider sustainability and health
objectives. Smarter use of technologies can reduce the need to travel. The transport system needs
to be balanced in favour of sustainable transport modes, giving people a real choice about how they
travel'. Therefore 'encouragement should be given to solutions which support reductions in greenhouse
gas emissions and reduce congestion".
14.9 To effectively influence the individual’s choice about their mode of travel, a range of options
must be available that provide accessible, attractive, safe and reliable alternative options in respect
of cost, time and convenience. Public transport has an important role to play in planning for
sustainability and future needs by facilitating sustainable developments, as well as by encouraging
a shift towards low carbon transport. An increase in the number of shorter journeys made on foot will
contribute towards sustainability by reducing carbon emissions, as well as being beneficial for health
and tackling congestion.
14.10 Investment in a high quality public realm linking housing, employment and town and village
centres encourages people to walk and cycle and positively manages vehicular access that enables
more sustainable patterns of travel. Well designed places with excellent public realm can quickly
establish the key function of a place therefore promoting the legibility of towns and villages, and
encouraging more sustainable lifestyles.
14.11 Cheshire East has strong links with neighbouring areas with an extensive road and rail
network including the M6 and West Coast Main Line giving access to Greater Manchester and London
Euston.
14.12 An effective freight network is essential for delivering sustainable economic growth. However,
the transportation of freight on roads through existing residential areas would not be considered
appropriate.
14.13 Policy Y1 (Travel to Education) of the Local Transport Plan 2011-2026 states that the council
will work with schools and colleges to enable sustainable travel to education, including appropriate
provision for those eligible for free or assisted transport.

Connectivity

14.14 Policy H8 (Road Safety) of the Local Transport Plan 2011-2026 states that the council will
improve road safety and take account of vulnerable road users. This includes the consideration of
where reduced speed limits would be appropriate (e.g. 20's Plenty Campaign for residential areas).

168

14.15 As currently proposed, the line of High Speed 2 (HS2) passes through the borough. HS2 will
have significant benefits for the borough and the sub-region and is anticipated to connect to the West
Coast Main Line just south of Crewe and will travel through parts of the borough. In addition,
Manchester Airport lies immediately to the north of the borough offering world wide services.
14.16 Improved cross boundary and public transport connections are sought with all surrounding
Local Authority areas and will be progressed through ongoing Duty to Co-operate arrangements.

The council will support the economic benefits of High Speed 2 whilst ensuring that
environmental and community impacts are minimised. Safeguarding Directions for Phases
2a and 2b of High Speed 2 (January and November 2016) are in place and are shown on
the Policies Map and the relevant Figures within the Crewe section of Chapter 15 of this
document, along with further detail within the Policy for site LPS 3 'Basford West'.
The council will work with neighbouring transport authorities and support proposals which
mitigate the wider impacts of development and improve connectivity, particularly by public
transport, so that the opportunities provided by economic growth can be accessible to a
wider population. Where appropriate, developers will be required to provide information on
cross boundary impacts and how these will be addressed through improvements to
sustainable travel options, which may include contributions to cross boundary transport
strategies where they exist.

In line with Policy S1: Spatial Planning of the Local Transport Plan 2011-2026.

preclude eventual re-use for transport purposes or impact on public safety .

Justification
14.17 Paragraph 17 of the NPPF states that 'significant development should be focused in locations
which are or can be made sustainable' . Good transport connections are integral to our ambitious
plans for economic growth and to the protection of our environment to ensure a sustainable future
for all our residents and businesses.

A selection of the major highway schemes listed in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan include:

A6 to Manchester Airport Relief Road
Improvements to the Crewe Green Roundabout junction and completion of Crewe Green Link

Improvements to the A34 and A555 corridors in Handforth
Improvements to the A537/A50 corridor through Knutsford
Improvements to the junction of B5077 Crewe Road/B5078 Sandbach Road in Alsager.
14.19 The council is committed to working with adjacent local authorities to mitigate the impact of
cross boundary travel. A refresh of the SEMMMS study is underway between Cheshire East and
Greater Manchester Authorities and a cross boundary strategy will also be prepared with Staffordshire
County Council and related Authorities. Developments may be required to contribute to any identified
measures where appropriate. Public funding for transport interventions will also be sought where
appropriate.
14.20 Climate change is nationally recognised as one of the most important challenges facing our
society. Transport accounts for 25% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the UK and personal
car travel is the single biggest contributor to individual CO2 emissions.
14.21 Statistics indicate that, in 2011, Cheshire East’s residents, commerce and industry and other
non-residential energy uses resulted in carbon dioxide emissions of 3.159m tonnes. This equates to
8.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions per person, which is more than the regional average of 7.0 tonnes per
person. However, CO2 emissions per person have fallen in recent years: from 10.6 tonnes in 2005
(88)
and 9.2 tonnes in 2010 . This has implications for local, regional and national air quality.

Connectivity

14.22 One of the most important ways of reducing carbon emissions is to reduce the need to travel,
particularly by private car, and to encourage more sustainable modes of transport such as cycling,
walking, buses and trains. Development should be located in areas close to existing facilities and
shops, and to transport hubs and bus routes. Maintaining or increasing the mix of uses in an area
reduces the need to travel, as well as adding vitality and diversity.

170

87
88

This applies to sites of former railway stations, sidings etc, as well as to the alignment of the line. Such areas can
provide essential space for interchanges, car parking, or other facilities associated with the new transport route.

series/sub-national-greenhouse-gas-emissions-statistics.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

14.23 The improvement of key transport links on the highway network will allow a better use of the
network for bus users and cyclists. There is also the potential for high occupancy vehicle lanes to be
provided in the future.
14.24 Another key element is to facilitate, where possible, ICT, broadband and other technologies
that remove the need to travel and to facilitate local access to these technologies. A flexible approach
to the emergence and uptake of new technologies will also be required where these offer attractive
and affordable communication or transport solutions.
14.25 The council will seek to ensure that development includes adequate parking provision for
bicycles. It will also seek to ensure that development includes adequate car parking provision where
there is clear and compelling justification that is it necessary to manage the road network. Provision
should be based on the car parking standards set out in Appendix C.
14.26 There is a case for Britain to develop a high-speed rail network, primarily because there is
a need for additional rail capacity in the future if we are to keep our economy moving. Building a
high-speed railway (rather than a conventional speed one) is the best way to do this, as the faster
journey times encourage people to switch from other, more carbon-hungry, modes of transport such
as aviation or car. Building new fast lines also frees up space on the current railway system to allow
more commuter or freight services, delivering further economic and environmental benefits.
14.27 High Speed 2 (HS2) is the most significant transport infrastructure project in the UK since
the motorways were built in the 1950s and 1960s. It will provide a high speed rail line between London
and Birmingham and on to Manchester and Leeds. Further details regarding HS2 will be included in
the Site Allocations and Development Policies Development Plan Document.

Digital Connections
14.28 Digital technologies have been a major driving force in influencing and shaping industry and

and community environments should be given due consideration and accommodated in the future
spatial design of Cheshire East.

Developers will be required to work with appropriate providers to deliver the necessary
physical infrastructure to accommodate information and digital communications (ICT)
networks as an integral part of all appropriate new developments.

provision of local community facilities and services. In preparing Local Plans, local planning authorities
should support the expansion of electronic communications networks, including telecommunications
and high speed broadband'.
14.30 New developments must be 'future-proof' with appropriate digital infrastructure that will meet
existing and future communication needs. It is essential that the Council works with developers to
make sure that the appropriate digital infrastructure is incorporated, including 4G and 5G networks.

5.

The Transport Assessment will need to demonstrate that the capacity and efficiency of the
highway network will not be severely affected as a result of the development. This should
be undertaken in accordance with the latest Cheshire East Council guidance;
The Transport Assessment and associated Travel Plan should demonstrate how the
proposed development will link into and enhance existing walking, cycling or public transport
infrastructure;
The Travel Plan will need to propose measures that will mitigate the impact of increased
trips generated on the highway network;
The Travel Plan should propose measures to facilitate and encourage the use of sustainable
travel alternatives (such as walking, cycling or public transport use), whilst discouraging
single occupancy vehicle travel and parking; and
Major developments will be required to monitor the effectiveness of the travel plan and the
traffic generated by that development and share data with the Local Authority.

Justification

Connectivity

14.31 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'all developments that generate significant
amounts of movement should be supported by a Transport Statement or Transport Assessment'.

172

14.32 Proposals for developments that are likely to have a significant transport impact will be
required to include a Transport Assessment and / or associated Travel Plan. This provides the
opportunity to assess traffic generation, identify measures to reduce traffic congestion and improve
accessibility by facilitating and encouraging sustainable modes of transport (walking, cycling, public
transport use and car sharing).
14.33 A Travel Plan is essentially an action plan designed to help organisations implement measures
to reduce the need for travel and to facilitate and encourage the remainder to travel more sustainably.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

It should help to reduce local traffic congestion, car parking problems and help to promote healthy
lifestyles, economic growth and environmental improvements.
14.34 For any new development, it is important to encourage sustainable travel options from day
one of occupation before car-based travel habits become established. Travel Plans can be origin-based
(Residential Travel Plans) or destination-based (Workplace / Business Travel Plans).
14.35 Travel Plans can help overcome concerns about new development by finding new ways of
addressing travel needs and demonstrating how to influence travel choices. They also offer numerous
benefits to developers, businesses, employers, employees, residents and the local community. Further
information on the purpose and benefits of Travel Plans and advice on how to prepare a Travel Plan
is provided in the Cheshire East Travel Planning Guidance Note.
14.36 Where there are major development proposals close to the council’s boundary, the council
will ensure that the cross border impacts are considered as part of the Transport Assessment and
liaise with the neighbouring transport authority.

15 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations
15.1 Paragraph 157 of the National Planning Policy Framework states that the Local Plan Strategy
should ‘allocate sites to promote development and flexible use of land, bringing forward new land
where necessary, and provide detail on form, scale, access and quantum of development where
appropriate.’
15.2 The Cheshire East Local Plan Strategy identifies both 'Sites' and 'Strategic Locations'. These
are proposed in locations that will contribute to providing balanced sustainable communities, where
there are housing and job opportunities, supported by key infrastructure and a range of services.
They consist of:
Local Plan Strategy Sites – Where the intended uses and location of development is precisely
defined and allocated on the Policies Map and is deliverable in the short to medium term.
Local Plan Strategy Strategic Locations – These are broadly-defined areas of land with the
capacity to deliver proposals of strategic importance, where definitive site boundaries and
intended uses will be included and allocated in the medium to long term in the Site Allocations
and Development Policies Document.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

15.3 The Local Plan Strategy focuses on identifying development proposals in and around Principal
Towns and Key Service Centres informed by the settlement hierarchy. The council will be preparing
a Site Allocations and Development Policies Document that will identify the remaining sites for
development, in particular around Local Service Centres.

176

15.4 It should be noted that an allocated site will still have to go through the planning application
process and the fact that it is allocated does not guarantee that planning permission will be granted,
although it does establish the principle of a particular land use. Planning applications on allocated
sites will be assessed against the policies in this document, the saved development plan policies and
other material planning considerations. It also needs to be recognised that planning applications can
be made for sites not identified in this document and these will be assessed against the relevant
policies of this document, the saved development plan policies and other material planning
considerations. Any subsequent planning permissions granted on previously unidentified land are
referred to as 'windfall' permissions.
15.5 All sites proposed in this section are expected to be developed in line with the policies of the
Local Plan Strategy unless it is otherwise specified in the relevant allocation policy.
The Assessment of Strategic Sites and Locations
15.6 The first step in seeking sites to allocate was to consider information available to the council
through contact and discussion with developers, landowners, agents and promoters, from responses
to earlier consultation stages in the preparation of the Local Plan Strategy, alongside sites currently
identified in evidence documents such as:
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA);
Employment Land Review;
Housing and Employment Land Databases;
Town Strategies; and
Neighbourhood Plans.
15.7 The initial list of sites were then consulted on early in 2013 as part of the Development Strategy,
with the preferred sites and locations being selected as those that were felt more appropriate to meet
the strategic vision, priorities and objectives of the Local Plan. These sites were all assessed as part
of the Sustainability Appraisal that accompanied the Development Strategy. A further selection of
sites were then consulted on as part of the Possible Additional Sites Consultation, to ensure that all
potential sites had been properly considered by the council, key stakeholders and the public. Following
on from this consultation, the council produced a Pre-Submission Core Strategy for consultation at
the end of 2013. The Pre-submission Core Strategy was a draft version of the Local Plan Strategy

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

and allowed a last opportunity for comments on the proposed plan prior to the publication of the
submission document.
15.8 The Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations contained within this document have
been selected using the council's Site Selection Methodology, which incorporates a thorough
assessment of all the evidence available to the council including:
consideration of the responses from the previous consultations;
the Sustainability Appraisal;
the Habitats Regulations Assessment;
the Flood Risk Assessment;
the Viability Assessment;
the Green Belt Assessment;
known physical constraints;
potential mitigation measures;
availability of the site;
conformity with the emerging Local Plan policies;
ability to contribute to the strategic vision, priorities and objectives of the Local Plan;
need for and contribution to infrastructure provision;
the Equality Impact Assessment;
the Rural Impact Assessment; and
the Health Impact Assessment.
15.9 The decision taken to allocate a site in this document is part of a balanced assessment of all
the information available.
Development Proposals
It is important to remember that:

15.13 The council will also look at the potential to bring forward sites from later phases of the plan
period to ensure that appropriate housing and employment provision is made. A review of employment
land and employment land allocations may also be undertaken to maximise efficient use of sites.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

15.10

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

177

the Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations are not listed in priority order;
where the Strategic Sites and Locations policies contain a list of criteria or proposals that these
are not in any order of importance or priority, unless the policy specifically states that they are;
proposals for new development will be assessed against all relevant policies in the Local Plan
and will be expected to be in conformity with those relevant policies unless other material planning
considerations dictate otherwise; and
national policy may not be repeated in these policies but will be applicable as appropriate.
Monitoring of Strategic Sites and Locations
15.11 This document has been produced at a time of national and local economic recovery and
for that reason has been designed to be flexible and to build in contingency. Whilst the council is
committed to the delivery of the Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations, it accepts that
there could be circumstances where development will not come forward entirely as anticipated.
Therefore, the Local Plan Strategy has an in-built mechanism to monitor performance through an
Authority Monitoring Report produced annually using performance indicators listed in Chapter 16 of
this document. Generally, the outcome of the monitoring process will inform whether specific
intervention actions should be pursued in the Local Plan Strategy. If these actions fail to address
under performance then other complementary plans and strategies should be reviewed.
15.12 The full range of intervention actions that the council and its partners could take is set out
in the monitoring chapter. These actions include the preparation of development briefs, completing
or contributing to surveys, and potentially undertaking Compulsory Purchase Orders to assist land
assembly and the overall delivery of the site.

Safeguarded Land
15.14 In order to avoid the need for future reviews of the Green Belt and in accordance with the
National Planning Policy Framework, it is necessary to identify areas of safeguarded land between
urban areas and Green Belt boundaries that may be required to meet longer-term development needs
stretching well beyond the period of the Local Plan, as set out in Policy PG 4 ‘Safeguarded Land’.
15.15 Safeguarded land is not allocated for development at the present time and policies relating
to development in the open countryside will apply. Planning permission for the permanent development
of safeguarded land should only be granted following a Local Plan review that proposes the
development. Any such review will need to take account of the development needs arising at that
time and the availability of other sources of land available at that point.
15.16 Safeguarded land is required around the larger settlements that are inset into the Green
Belt; Macclesfield, Handforth, Knutsford, Poynton and Wilmslow. Other settlements (such as Alsager
and Congleton) are adjacent to the Green Belt boundary but are not completely surrounded by it and
therefore retain the capacity to expand in the future without incursions into the Green Belt.
Maps
15.17 Ordnance Survey based maps are provided for each town showing the development related
proposals, as well as commitments (strategic developments that already have permission) and larger
scale maps of each site and strategic location. These maps are presented for illustrative purposes.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

15.18 The definitive spatial application of the proposals that will be land allocations and consequential
policy boundary changes are to be shown on the new Policies Map. This will be an update of the
combined Proposals Maps produced as part of the previous Local Plans adopted by the former district
and county councils.

Crewe
15.19 When considering options for development, there is a need to consider Crewe in its wider
context. From its inception, Cheshire East has identified Crewe as its biggest spatial priority and has
developed the All Change for Crewe: High Growth City strategy in response to this. The All Change
for Crewe: High Growth City strategy proposes that by 2030 Crewe will be:
A nationally significant economic centre;
A key driver and hub for investment, connectivity, enterprise and business across the South
Cheshire sub-region;
Widely recognised as an important anchor to the North West region;
One of the leading advanced engineering and manufacturing centres in England, building on its
rich industrial heritage and successful outward-facing firms, with a major focus on automotive,
advanced engineering and advanced manufacturing sectors;
Recognised as a sought-after place in South Cheshire; where talented and able people want to
live, work and play, and where once previously deprived areas of the town have been completely
revitalised and re-energised;
An improved strategic transport network and a state-of-the-art broadband internet network;
Home to premier educational facilities;
A diversified 'knowledge economy' that attracts and keeps hi-tech firms and skilled workers; and
A green and improved town environment and health and well-being of its residents, through the
requirement for development schemes to improve existing and to provide new green infrastructure.

15.21 Further information about each of the identified Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic
Locations can be found on the following pages.

High Speed Rail 2
15.22 Proposals for High Speed Rail (HS2) will consolidate the position of Crewe as one of the
most connected areas in the UK and will support existing businesses, inward investment and job
creation. The council supports the economic benefits of High Speed Rail (HS2) but will look to minimise
its environmental impacts.
15.23 The government has announced its proposals for a High Speed Rail Line which links the
West Midlands with Manchester. Called HS2 (phase two), it will pass through various parts of Cheshire
East. The current proposals will have a potential transformative impact on Crewe and the local
economy in line with aspirations established in High Growth City.
15.24 Any future proposal for High Speed Rail 2 might necessitate significant change in Crewe. In
this event, the council could prepare an Area Action Plan or similar document that would most likely
focus around the area referenced in the HS2 Command Paper 9355, published on 15th November
2016, as a hub station for Crewe or alternatively trigger a review of the Local Plan Policies.
15.25 Safeguarding Directions for Phases 2a and 2b of High Speed 2 (January and November
2016) are in place and are shown on the Policies Map and the relevant Figures within this Chapter,
along with further detail within the policy for site LPS 3 'Basford West'.

Figure 15.1 Crewe Town Map

Strategic Location LPS 1: Central Crewe
15.26 Central Crewe comprising the town centre, Mill Street, Crewe Railway Station and Crewe
Alexandra Football Ground presents a range of development and regeneration opportunities in Central
Crewe which will deliver a high quality and accessible environment and present the opportunity for
improvement and regeneration.
15.27 Central Crewe is characterised by three main development areas: the traditional town centre;
Grand Junction Retail Park and the railway station (with adjoining areas of Nantwich Road.) Despite
its origins as a railway town, Crewe town centre has historically developed some distance from the
railway station. This disconnection has been exacerbated by the development of the Grand Junction
Retail Park from the late 1990's onwards which is separate from the town centre. To ensure that

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Crewe thrives in the future, connectivity needs to be improved; the design of new buildings needs to
be of a high standard and green infrastructure needs to be incorporated in new developments, to
enhance the town's environment and improve the health and wellbeing of residents.

Provision of other commercial uses including office;
Support for an enhanced cultural offer, in particular around the Lyceum Theatre;
Support for 24 hour town centre uses, including restaurants and cafés/bars;
Support of multi-use facilities that drive footfall generation and introduce a diversity of uses
within the town centre;
The incorporation of new, and improvements to existing, green infrastructure within new
developments to include increased tree planting; the creation of tree lined boulevards; the
creation of green spaces; the provision of children's play areas and the provision of
pedestrian and cycle links between new and existing developments;
Appropriately sited, rationalised and improved car parking to support town centre uses and
the local economy;
A bus interchange with covered areas and public conveniences;
Promotion of the market with a unique theme;
A focus for Civic functions;
Provision of new car parking, signage, concourse, public transport interchange and improved
station facilities (including ancillary development relating to its use) at Crewe Railway Station;
Up to 5,000 square metres of retail on Mill Street and the creation of pedestrian and cycle
links to the railway station and the town centre;
Potential leisure development and expansion of the existing sports and leisure hub at Crewe
Alexandra Football Club on Gresty Road;
Provision of Flag Lane link to improve access and permeability of the town;
Corridor improvements on Earle Street from Grand Junction Way to Vernon Way;
Improvements to the wider highway network, including the A534 Nantwich Road Corridor
and specifically in relation to the access to Crewe Railway Station;
Improvements to Crewe Railway Station, including the development of adjacent land for
complementary uses, to improve connectivity at this major communications hub; and
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

Site Specific Principles of Development
a.

The creation of stronger physical connections between the town centre, the railway station
and Grand Junction including the provision of better transport information between the town
centre and railway station.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

Within the Strategic Location identified as Central Crewe, the council will look to maximise
opportunities for improvement and regeneration incorporating the introduction of new and the
improvement of existing green infrastructure. The regeneration and development of Central
Crewe over the Local Plan Strategy period will be achieved through:

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

j.

182

The promotion of development which capitalises on and enhances Crewe Railway Station's
position as a major communications hub.
The encouragement of landmark developments of an appropriate design in particular at
Macon Way to reflect this prominent location. This should include offices or other commercial
uses (not retail).
New buildings should be of a high design quality and respond to Crewe's railway heritage
and contemporary living. The new development should sensitively retain and incorporate
any heritage buildings and/or structures within them.
Provision of green infrastructure to reflect 'The Green Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe'
(TEP, 2012) including tree planting; the creation of tree lined boulevards with the provision
of greenspaces within new developments. The creation of green spaces including those
linking green infrastructure and safe and secure pedestrian and cycle routes should be
integrated into any development proposals.
Investigate potential of land contamination.
Provision of new, and improvements to existing pedestrian, cycle and public transport links
between existing and proposed residential areas, employment, commercial and leisure
areas, schools and health facilities and within the town centre itself.
Depending on the location within the town, a cultural heritage desk based assessment of
th
the surviving fabric of the 19 Century railway town and its industrial heritage may be
required; proposals should also demonstrate that redevelopment proposals will conserve
elements that contribute to listed buildings status and their setting.
Financial contributions towards education provision, highway improvements and health
infrastructure as required.
There are three Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) within the site at Earle Street,
Nantwich Road and Wistaston Road. Development proposals will need to include appropriate
mitigation measures if they are located within these AQMAs or could have an adverse
impact upon them.

Justification
15.28 Central Crewe presents a unique opportunity to regenerate under-exploited assets and
provide a strong mix of uses.
15.29 The area includes a significant number of listed and locally-listed buildings. Crewe's railway
heritage is of regional, if not national significance. It is of paramount important that such buildings
are retained and sensitively incorporated within any new developments.
15.30 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and well-being of residents and
those working within the town, as well as enhancing the environment of the town and reflects the
findings of the Green Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe (TEP, 2012) and will also help deliver the
'All Change for Crewe' vision.
15.31 The focus on Central Crewe in the Local Plan Strategy will be on re-establishing the town
centre, improving its vitality and viability and improving connectivity between the railway station and
town centre. The changes set out above will provide a catalyst for future investment, promoting a
series of infill developments whilst addressing the potential to rationalise car parking provision in the
town centre.
15.32
This development area supports the 'All Change for Crewe' initiative to enhance the
attractiveness of Crewe as a place to live and work, develop underutilised sites and improve the
town's public image.

15.34 Highway improvements along the A534 Nantwich Road corridor and specifically in relation
to the access to Crewe Railway Station are fundamental, to ensure that the highway network can
cope with future developments.
15.35 The introduction of residential accommodation will support and enhance the town centre,
improving natural surveillance and the vitality of the night time economy. It will also support the wider
aspirations of creating better, safer and improved links between the railway station and the town
centre.
15.36 New residential development can assist in promoting the connections between the town
centre and the railway station, as well as improving the approach to the town from the south-east
and the north-west. The introduction of further residential development in this area will also deliver
a balance of uses which are essential to successful urban environments, as well as a catalyst for
transforming the quality of streets and public spaces.
15.37 The town centre boundary along with the identification of primary and secondary frontages
will be further defined in the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document. Until this time the
town centre boundary will remain as identified in the Crewe and Nantwich Local Plan.
15.38 There is a current planning permission on Mill Street (P07/0639) for mixed use development
comprising residential, employment and retail, new pedestrian / cycle link and associated car parking,
landscaping, servicing and access.
15.39 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.40 Three AQMAs lie within the site and therefore any development proposals need to ensure
that air quality does not deteriorate, as a result of development taking place. Appropriate mitigation
measures will therefore be required where sites are located within them/would have an adverse
impact upon them.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Site LPS 2: Basford East, Crewe
15.42 Basford East presents the opportunity to create a high quality employment led, vibrant and
sustainable, mixed use development with excellent links to Crewe and the M6 Motorway. This gateway
site into Crewe will provide employment opportunities and homes of high quality to facilitate the
delivery of employment on the site. Key to the site's comprehensive delivery will be the Crewe Green
Link Road South.
15.43 The site is a large greenfield site covering approximately 92 hectares. The site is bordered
by the West Coast Mainline (to the west) and Stoke-on-Trent / Nottingham rail line (to the north), and
the A500 to the south.

Site LPS 2
Basford East, Crewe
The development of Basford East over the Local Plan Strategy period will be achieved through:

3.

The delivery of up to 19 hectares of B1 Office Space, up to 5 hectares of B2 floor space;
to include the creation of a fourth generation business park, with generous green
infrastructure provision. The site is not considered to be suitable for B8 uses, due to highway
constraints;
The delivery of up to 850 new homes, ancillary to the delivery of employment uses on the
site. The delivery of more than 850 new homes on the site will only be permitted if this can
be justified by the submission of a viability study. Such a study will be independently
evaluated, on behalf of Cheshire East Council, such costs to be borne by the developer(s);

One new primary school located to the eastern edge of the site;
Retail provision appropriate to local needs;
Public house / restaurant; and
A community facility that will be capable of accommodating a variety of uses;

A significant depth of native woodland and other semi-natural habitat screening along
all boundaries to provide a buffer between the development and the railway line (at
least 20metres) and the A500 (at least 40metres), to offset detrimental visual impact
to the open countryside and the setting of the grade 1 listed Crewe Hall and its
registered park and garden, along with the creation of wildlife habitats, including those
for protected species;
The retention, where possible, of important hedgerows that have a cumulative screening
impact on development and contribute to the habitat value of the site;
The protection and enhancement of Basford Brook;
The creation of drainage ponds that have visual and habitat potential;
Allotments; and
Open space including sports pitches; multi use games area; outdoor gym; equipped
children's play space and facilities for teenagers;

The provision of a pedestrian link (also allowing for cycle access) over the Crewe Green
Link Road South;
The provision of contributions to local health infrastructure.

a.

h.

The site must be developed on a comprehensive basis. To ensure that the impact upon
protected species is minimised, the development of the site shall take place starting in the
south and finishing in the north, on a phased basis. The council will not permit the
development of small portions of the site, unless it can be demonstrated that they contribute
to and complement the development as a whole.
As part of a comprehensive masterplan for the site, provision must be made for a community
facility that contains space that can be used for a number of uses, on a flexible basis.
The development would be expected to contribute towards road infrastructure improvements
in the area, including the Crewe Green Link Road, A500 link capacity improvements, A5020
Weston Road junction and junction 16 of the M6.
The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
Environmental mitigation required as part of the Crewe Green Link Road South scheme
will be safeguarded from development. The development should provide compensatory
habitat for great crested newts and other protected and priority species on the site. The
great crested newt mitigation areas shall be contiguous with that provided for the Crewe
Green Link Road South, within a zone adjacent to the northern boundary of the site, parallel
to the railway corridor.
The development would be expected to provide contributions towards improvements to
existing, and the provision of new, public transport links to Crewe Railway Station, Crewe
town centre and local villages.
The development would be expected to allow continued access to and servicing of the
adjacent railways including improved access to the Rail Depot from Crewe Green Link Road
South.
The development would be expected to provide improvements to existing, and include the
provision of new pedestrian, cycle and public transport links to existing and proposed
residential and employment areas, shops, schools and health facilities.

The development will provide connections to the South Cheshire Growth Village, South
East Crewe, in the form of green infrastructure, pedestrian and cycle links with further
consideration of comprehensively masterplanning both schemes.
The provision of green infrastructure, to reflect 'The Green Infrastructure Action Plan for
Crewe' (TEP, 2012) including tree planting; the creation of tree lined boulevards with the
provision of greenspaces within new developments. This should include the creation of
green spaces, including those linking green infrastructure, with safe and secure pedestrian
and cycle routes that should be integrated into any development proposals.
High quality employment provision on the site is key to its delivery, with housing considered
ancillary and required in order to ensure the deliverability of this site.
The development should provide a quality of place with pedestrian and cycle links through
to Crewe Railway Station and beyond to Crewe town centre.
A desk based archaeological assessment shall be carried out; if it requires further work and
mitigation, this will be completed, as required.
The area has a 'typical' Cheshire Landscape, characterised by a flat topography broken up
with a dense network of field hedges interspersed with mature hedgerow trees. The
development of Basford East must respond to this sensitive landscape setting and create
a new high quality environment.
Existing farm buildings offer the potential for conversion to alternative uses.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.
There are several ponds located on the site and a range of mature trees and hedgerows
which are of ecological value.
The site is located in close proximity to the grade 1 listed Crewe Hall and its grade II listed
registered park and garden; any development on the site will need to ensure that it does
not have an adverse impact upon its setting.
th
Existing buildings of Crotia Mill Farm, on the site, are thought to lie on the site of a 14
Century water mill. Archaeological investigations will be an important consideration across
the site but particularly in relation to this farm complex.
Records show that there is potential for some areas of infill associated with former ponds
and a mill lake, and there may be areas of localised contamination associated with Crotia
Mill Farm (formerly a mill) on site.
The Crewe Green Link Road South runs through the site. The site will deliver a pedestrian
and cycle link over the Crewe Green Link Road South.
Future masterplanning and development of the site should take into account potential
impacts from High Speed Rail Two.
Appropriate noise mitigation measures must be included with future development proposals
for the site.

Justification
15.44 At present, Basford East is a mix of arable, improved grassland and semi-improved grassland
which also contains a river habitat. Basford Brook flows through the heart of the site alongside several
groupings of ponds, which support interesting flora and fauna. Surrounding uses include the railway,
the A500, Crewe Hall registered park and garden and open countryside. There are also a range of
mature trees and hedgerows which are of ecological value.
15.45 The principle of developing this area has been accepted in previous Development Plans.
Basford East is allocated for strategic and major industrial and business related development within
the Crewe and Nantwich Local Plan. Use Classes B1, B2 and B8 were considered to be appropriate
on this site. However, B8 uses are no longer considered to be appropriate, due to highway constraints.

15.47 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents and
employees, as well as enhancing the environment of the town and reflects the findings of the Green
Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe (TEP, 2012) and will also help deliver the aspirations of 'All
Change for Crewe: High Growth City' .
15.48 The Crewe Green Link Road (South) scheme (CGLRS) is a 1.1 km dual-carriageway link
running north-south between the Weston Gate roundabout on the A5020 Weston Road and the A500
Hough-Shavington Bypass. The scheme was granted planning permission in October 2011. A revised
planning application was progressed through 2012, and this was granted in January 2013. A
Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) for the land required to construct, operate and maintain the
scheme was made and confirmed during November 2013. The scheme was completed in 2015.
15.49 Future masterplanning and development of the site should take into account potential impacts
from High Speed Rail Two (HS2).
15.50 The provision of a local centre, including appropriate medical facilities; a new primary school;
local retail; pub/restaurant and a community facility, with space that can be used for a number of
uses, on a flexible basis is essential, to ensure that the site is sustainable. The community facility
must be formed of flexible space to accommodate uses including toilets; kitchen and storage and be

15.46 The provision of employment development is the principal and overriding objective of the
Basford East site. The housing development will act as an 'enabler' to ensure that the employment
development takes place. If any more than 850 new homes are proposed to be delivered on this site
a viability study will be required to be submitted. This will be independently evaluated, on behalf of
Cheshire East Council and the cost for this will be borne by the developer(s). This is to ensure that
the objective of delivering an employment site, to support the aims of 'All Change for Crewe: High
Growth City', will be met.

capable of a variety of uses such as clubs (for people of all ages), community meetings and as a
place of worship.
15.51 Basford Brook has been selected as a local wildlife site and flows through the heart of the
site providing the greatest source of flood risk. A site specific Flood Risk Assessment will be required
on the site that should consider future transport infrastructure including impacts of High Speed Rail
Two (HS2). Any infrastructure planned over the brook or in the floodplain should be designed to not
impact on flood flow. Culverting part or the entire brook is not recommended. Masterplanning of the
site should avoid areas at greatest source of flood risk.
15.52 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.53 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.
15.54 As the site is located adjacent to a railway line, roads and industrial noise sources, it is
important that appropriate noise mitigation measures are incorporated within the development.
15.55 Planning approvals on the site are as follows: 14/4025N: outline approval for up to 490
dwellings, primary school, recreational open space, ecological mitigation areas. Resolution to grant
planning approval (15/04/15) subject to signing of S106 Legal Agreement, signed on 15 January
2016. 15/1537N: outline application for mixed use development comprising up to 325 dwellings, B1,
D1, A1 and A3/4, creation of footpaths and public open space. Resolution to grant planning approval
(Strategic Planning Board 16 December 2015) subject to the signing of a S106 Agreement yet to be
signed.

improvements,the provision of a spine road; improvements to junction 16 of the M6 and
other traffic management and regulations.
Improvements to existing, and the provision of new, pedestrian and cycle links to connect
the site to existing and proposed residential areas, employment areas, shops, schools and
health facilities.
The development would be expected to allow continued access to and servicing of the
adjacent railways.
Development should incorporate green infrastructure and reflect 'The Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe' (TEP, 2012), including tree planting; the creation of tree lined
boulevards with the provision of greenspaces within new developments. This should include
the creation of green spaces, including those linking green infrastructure with safe and
secure pedestrian and cycle routes that should be integrated into any development proposals.
Future masterplanning and development of the site should take into account potential
impacts from High Speed Rail Two.
Development must not have an adverse impact on the established great crested newt habitat
areas.
A financial contribution will be sought from developers to fund tree planting at appropriate
locations.
On site provision, or where appropriate, relevant contributions towards transport and
highways, education, health, open space and community facilities.
The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
The development would be expected to contribute to improvements to existing and the
provision of new public transport links to Crewe Railway Station, Crewe town centre and
local villages.
The site has potential for the provision of rail sidings with good rail access for the
trans-shipment of freight between railway and road and/or rail connected warehousing and
distribution. If this is not provided within the site, a larger contribution to road infrastructure
improvements will be required.
Habitat and appropriate mitigation measures to be provided within the site for protected
species.
The masterplanning of the site will need to ensure that the development is located within
the site in such a way that it will not have any adverse impact on existing and proposed
protected species habitat.
The Basford area has a 'typical' Cheshire landscape, characterised by a flat topography
broken up with a dense network of field hedges interspersed with mature hedgerow trees.
The development of Basford West will need to respond to this sensitive landscape setting.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

Justification
15.58 At present the site comprises open farmland, with mature trees and hedgerows. It is known
to support some interesting flora and fauna, including great crested newts. Surrounding uses include
the railway to the east; the A500 to the south; Crewe Road to the north and west, with mainly ribbon
residential development to the west, on Crewe Road.
15.59 The principle of developing this area has been accepted in previous Development Plans.
The strategic site is a development plan allocation for regional and strategic employment identified
in the Crewe and Nantwich Local Plan and known as Basford West. An outline planning application
(ref P03/1071) for employment uses and associated works was granted permission on 13 May 2008
on the majority of the land within the employment allocation.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

15.60 Outline planning approval (14/0378N) was granted on the eastern portion of the site for
96,851 square metres of B2 and B8 uses on 18 July 2014.
15.61 An outline planning application, on part of the site, for residential development (up to 370
units), offices, local centre, restaurant, hotel, car showroom and new spine road was approved, subject
to S.106, by Strategic Planning Board in August 2013 (ref 13/0336N). Reserved matters planning
approval for up to 370 dwellings, local centre (A1), public house (A3/4), hotel (C1) and car showroom
was approved on 24 September 2015.
15.62 The provision of employment development is the principal and overriding objective of the
Basford West site. A viability assessment has been submitted, to justify the provision of 370 new
homes on the site. The housing development will act as an 'enabler' to ensure that the employment
development takes place. If any more than 370 new homes are proposed to be delivered on this site
a viability study will be required to be submitted. This will be independently evaluated, on behalf of
Cheshire East Council and the cost for this will be borne by the developer(s). This is to ensure that
the objective of delivering an employment site, to support the aims of 'All Change for Crewe; High
Growth City' are met.
15.63 The delivery of the employment elements of the site, as well as the contributions that it will
make towards infrastructure improvements, including the A500, Crewe Green Link Road, junction 16
of the M6 and the spine road, are considered to be of vital importance to the delivery of “All Change
for Crewe”.
15.64 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents and
employees, as well as enhancing the environment of the town and reflects the findings of the Green
Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe (TEP, 2012) and will also help deliver the aspirations of 'All
Change for Crewe: High Growth City' .

15.65 Habitat for protected species and appropriate mitigation will be provided within the site; the
development will have to be appropriately sited, to ensure that there is not any adverse impact on
such habitat areas.
15.66 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.67 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.
15.68 The council expects that the following are considered in the context of the ecological value
of the site due to its proximity to a European site(s):

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

impact on natural hydrological function, pathways, groundwater and surface water
Impact on recharge to groundwater and consequent impact on site
impact on water resources
impact on water chemistry
impacts on nutrient status
risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils and fuels)
impacts from changes to air quality from construction and ‘end use’ traffic emissions resulting
in potential for increased nitrogen deposition
impacts from dust generated during the construction work
impact of increased foot traffic on sensitive habitats and species

15.69 At the date of the adoption of this Local Plan Strategy, part of Site LPS 3 Basford West,
Crewe is subject to the 'Safeguarding Directions Fradley to Crewe' given by the Secretary of State
for Transport which came into force on 12 January 2016, which include proposals for an Infrastructure
Maintenance Depot (IMD) at Crewe ("the Safeguarding Directions"). However, in September 2016,
the Secretary of State published the 'High Speed Two Phase 2a: West Midlands to Crewe Design
Refinement Consultation', which includes the potential relocation of the proposed IMD to a site near
Stone in Staffordshire. The consultation took place between 13 September and 7 November 2016.
In the event that the 'HS2 Phase 2 West Midlands to Crewe Hybrid Bill' includes an IMD located at
Stone, the council anticipates that the Secretary of State will withdraw the Safeguarding Directions
affecting Site LPS 3.
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that the employment land will be delivered during the middle part of the plan period
(2020-2025).

15.73 Traffic studies have been undertaken to look at the effect of the traffic generated by the
Leighton West site on the highway network. This has highlighted issues at the junctions of the A530
with Flowers Lane and also with Smithy Lane, both of which are in close proximity of the site and
would require improvements to be made, to enable them to handle the additional demand at these
locations, as a result of the Leighton West development.
15.74 The work undertaken also shows that improvements will be required at other junctions to
facilitate the growth in traffic expected as a result of the Leighton West development and other

for Crewe: High Growth City’. The site will help to deliver the future expansion of Leighton
Hospital, to ensure that it can provide the healthcare needs for the area, as it grows, along
with key improvements to highways; the ‘blue light’ portal and public transport serving the
hospital. The close proximity of the site to Bentley provides an opportunity for the creation
of an automotive hub which will provide new employment opportunities and expand the
automotive related investment in Crewe and the wider area.
Development should incorporate green infrastructure and reflect 'The Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe' (TEP, 2012) including tree planting; the creation of tree lined
boulevards with the provision of greenspaces within new developments. This should include
the creation of green spaces, including those linking green infrastructure, with safe and
secure pedestrian and cycle routes that should be integrated into any development proposals.
Leighton West includes a potential site for the location of a deep geothermal plant. Following
work by leading academics at Keele University, Cheshire East Council is investigating the
feasibility of using deep geothermal energy to supply a district heating network in the vicinity,
to potentially supply new residential developments, major industrial units, and nearby
Leighton Hospital.
Improved highway and public transport links to Leighton Hospital, Crewe town centre and
major employment areas.
Contributions to key enabling infrastructure, including improvements to the A530 corridor
from the Flowers Lane and Smithy Lane junctions with the A530 and the Bradfield Road /
North Street corridor.
Improvements to existing and the provision of new pedestrian and cycle links to connect
the site to existing and proposed residential areas, employment areas, shops, schools,
health facilities, Crewe town centre and the Connect2 link to Nantwich.
A green buffer should be provided between Leighton Hospital and the village of Bradfield
Green.
The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
Provision of habitat for great crested newts and other protected and priority species and
habitats as required.
Investigate the potential for contamination issues, especially in relation to land to the south
of the site. A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land
should be carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use
should it be found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be
required at a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.
Following the findings of a desk based archaeological assessment, targeted mitigation is
likely to be required in areas not subject to a geophysical survey.
Development should be masterplanned to facilitate highway improvements required to
mitigate against the impact of the new development and address existing pinch points,
including the Flowers Lane and Smithy Lane junctions with the A530.
Any development of the Leighton West site will require highway improvements. These
improvements will be phased with the development of the site and also delivered through
masterplanning of the area covered by both the Leighton West and the Leighton Strategic
Sites.

The provision of employment land on the site offers the opportunity to establish a
science/energy park and a key site for the development of an automotive research, development and
supply hub, in close proximity to Bentley Motors. This site offers a single location with good access
to infrastructure and linkages to the wider area. In 2013, Bentley Motors announced a £1billion
investment in Crewe from 2015. Working in partnership with Bentley Motors and key businesses
across the United Kingdom this site provides the opportunity to expand Crewe’s significant automotive
heritage and skills base; to provide new employment opportunities and to kickstart wider automotive
related investment in Crewe, in line with the aspirations contained in ‘All Change for Crewe: High
Growth City’.
15.76 The provision of land adjacent to Leighton Hospital for its future expansion will ensure that
the future health care needs of the town are met and will help to deliver the aspirations of ‘All Change
for Crewe: High Growth City’.
15.77 Masterplanning of the site should consider further constraints on the site including high
voltage power lines which cross the site from the south west to the north which require an easement
of 30m to the nearest building.
15.78 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents and
employees, as well as enhancing the environment of the town and reflects the findings of the Green
Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe (TEP, 2012) and will also help deliver the aspirations of ‘All
Change for Crewe: High Growth City’.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

15.79 It is important that cycle and pedestrian links between the site and surrounding residential
and employment areas and to Crewe town centre are provided to improve connectivity with the town
centre. Links should also be provided to the Connect 2 scheme.
15.80 Great crested newts are known to be present on site. There will therefore be a requirement
to deliver a significant area of habitat creation to compensate for the impacts of any development on
this site.
15.81 Access to Leighton Hospital will be a key consideration in the development of this site and
its improvement is part of the rationale for it. Provision of land adjacent to Leighton Hospital, for future
expansion is of importance, to ensure that the future health care needs of the area can be met.
15.82 A desk-based assessment of archaeology on site has been completed and a geophysical
survey for the eastern area. Given the size of the area, targeted mitigation is likely to be required in
areas not subject to geophysical survey.
15.83 Land adjacent to this site (known as land north of Parkers Road) has planning permission
for up to 400 homes.
15.84 This site includes a potential location for a geothermal plant, as it is situated within an area
that has been identified as a geothermal 'hotspot'. This provides the opportunity for the development
of a district heating scheme; energy supply to nearby employers and to Leighton Hospital. The potential
development of a geothermal plant is a stand alone proposal and would not require housing
development to cross-subsidise it.

15.86 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.
15.87 The design and density of the development should reflect the location and character of the
area and respond to the contents of the council’s most up to date Design Guidance.
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that the employment land will be delivered in the early to middle part of the plan
period (2015-2025).

Quality habitat and provision of habitat for great crested newts and other protected species
as required.
A desk based archaeological assessment is required for the site, with appropriate mitigation
being carried out, if required.
There will be a requirement for financial contributions to be made to the provision of a new
primary school, on the adjacent Leighton West site LPS 4 or improved educational facilities,
as required.
Any development of the Leighton West site will require highway improvements. These
improvements will be phased with the development of the site and also delivered through
masterplanning of the area covered by both the Leighton West Strategic Site LPS 4 and
this site. This will include contributions to key enabling infrastructure, including improvements
to the A530 corridor and Sydney Road/ Flowers Lane/ Remer Street/ Bradfield Road corridor.
Financial contributions towards health infrastructure as required.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be

15.91 Land adjacent to part of this site (known as land north of Parkers Road) has planning
permission for up to 400 homes, is listed in the commitments list and is under construction. The site
is in a number of ownerships.
15.92 The opportunity is presented by this strategic site for new homes to be delivered at a
sustainable location, in close proximity to Bentley Motors and the new automotive hub that will be
created at the southern end of the Leighton West site. In turn this will assist in delivering the growth
aspirations for Crewe of 'Northern Gateway' (formerly known as ‘All Change for Crewe: High Growth
City’).
15.93 This strategic site is intended to deliver key highways improvements in and around the area
known as Leighton West, which will facilitate the development and address current and future
congestion issues in the area.
15.94 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents, as
well as enhancing the environment of the town and reflects the findings of 'The Green Infrastructure

The provision of a high quality design on this gateway site to Crewe, which lies in close
proximity to the Crewe Green Conservation Area and numerous listed buildings. Development
should have regard to the need to conserve and enhance the character and appearance
of the conservation area, including its setting and that of the various heritage assets within
it. Development will be required to include appropriate landscaping to minimise its impact
on the Green Gap and the historic environment.
The development of this site will assist in the facilitation and delivery of highway
improvements at Crewe Green roundabout.
The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
Development should incorporate green infrastructure and reflect 'The Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe' (TEP, 2012) including tree planting; the creation of tree lined
boulevards with the provision of greenspaces within new developments. This should include
the creation of green spaces, including those linking green infrastructure, with safe and
secure pedestrian and cycle routes that should be integrated into any development proposals.
The improvement of existing and provision of new pedestrian and cycle links to link new
and existing residential areas, employment areas, shops, schools and health facilities.
The inclusion of appropriate planting and buffering along the northern boundary of the site.
Provision of habitat for protected species, if required.
The development will be expected to provide contributions to education provision and health
infrastructure.
A desk based archaeological assessment is required for the site, with appropriate mitigation
being carried out, if required.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

15.104 This site is a gateway site into Crewe. The development of this site will assist in the delivery
of improvements to the Crewe Green roundabout which is a key piece of highway infrastructure and
is identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan which states that the roundabout suffers from peak
period delays and includes it within the ‘Physical Infrastructure Delivery Schedule'.
15.105 The key gateway location of the site, along with its close proximity to Crewe Green
Conservation Area, necessitates the delivery of a very high quality designed development, including
appropriate landscaping to reduce the visual impact of the development. The provision of new green
infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure are of paramount importance.
This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents, as well as enhancing the environment
of the town and reflects the findings of the Green Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe (TEP, 2012)
and will also help deliver the aspirations of ‘All Change for Crewe: High Growth City’.
15.106 Funding sources for improvements to the Crewe Green roundabout are a Local Growth
Fund Grant and third-party developer contributions secured by the council.
15.107

Habitat for protected species must be provided if required.

15.108

The development will be expected to provide contributions to education provision.

15.109 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.110 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.

15.112 Green infrastructure provision underpins future development in Crewe, ensuring that it is
a pleasant place to live and work. Any proposals should take into account the Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe.
15.113 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents, as
well as enhancing the environment of the town and reflects the findings of the Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe (TEP, 2012) and will also help deliver the aspirations of ‘All Change for Crewe:

15.114 Mechanisms must be put in place, to ensure that water from the development, flowing into
Fowle Brook, does not have an adverse impact on the Sandbach Flashes SSSI.
15.115 Adjacent land lies within the Green Gap. It is important that any visual impact of development
on the Green Gap is minimised by appropriate landscaping and the retention of existing trees and
hedgerows.
15.116 It is important that the site contributes to highway improvements along the North Crewe
corridor, including at Sydney Road Bridge and Crewe Green Roundabout, to ensure highway safety.
15.117 It is important that ecological appraisals of the site are carried out and that habitat and
appropriate mitigation measures for protected species, if required, will be provided. Mitigation proposals
for great crested newts in particular are likely to be necessary.
15.118 It is important that buffering planting, along the western boundary of the site, with the West
Coast Mainline is provided in such a way that noise and disturbance are mitigated to an acceptable
level.

15.119 Applications made on the site are as follows: outline application for up to 240 dwellings
(13/2055N) approved with conditions 14/08/2015; outline application for 12 dwellings (15/2818N) on
a small part of the site - a resolution to grant planning permission (subject to a S.106 agreement)
was made on the 25th November 2015; outline application for up to 275 dwellings (15/0184N) is yet
to be determined and is under appeal for non-determination; outline application for 250 dwellings
(15/5184N) has also been submitted to run alongside the appeal in relation to application reference
15/0184N and has yet to be determined.
15.120 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up

15.121 The design and density of the development should reflect the location and character of the
area and respond to the contents of the council’s most up to date Design Guidance.
15.122 There will be a need for improved educational facilities to be provided as a result of this
development taking place, therefore a contribution towards this is required.
15.123 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.
15.124 Due to the location of the site, adjacent to roads and a railway line, noise mitigation design
will be required for proposed dwellings closest to these noise sources.
15.125 Crewe Public Footpath No.4 crosses the site. This footpath would require upgrading as
part of any development of the site; appropriate policy wording to ensure that this was achieved would
therefore be required.

Site LPS 8
South Cheshire Growth Village, South East Crewe
A new sustainable settlement will be delivered over the Local Plan Strategy period. This will be
achieved through:
1.

2.

The delivery of around 650 new homes. The density and scale of the development should
reflect the sensitivities and relationships of different parts of the site and should be directly
informed by a detailed heritage impact assessment that will inform and shape a development
brief, masterplan and design code for the site. This should have special regard to the
relationship to heritage assets and their settings and their collective character and
significance and what this rich heritage context contributes to the character of the site and
to its wider setting;
The provision of a new mixed-use local (village) centre, with a range of uses, including:

assets (where those are appropriate to the setting of the heritage assets) to offset
detrimental visual impact to the open countryside and the setting of designated heritage
assets;
Parkland restoration to the north of Old Park Road in the historic parkland of Crewe
Hall (including the registered park and garden) would include the retention and
restoration of the shelterbelt, clumps of trees and other parkland features;
Additionally, the retention, where possible, of hedgerows and trees within the site that
have a cumulative screening impact on development and contribute to the habitat
value of the site;
Other targeted landscape mitigation as set out in the Heritage Impact Assessment
(CEC 2016) and summarised under part b of ‘Site Specific Principles of Development’
below;
The creation of drainage ponds that have visual and habitat potential, allotments and
a community orchard.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Site Specific Principles of Development

b.

Development should incorporate green infrastructure and reflect 'The Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe' (TEP, 2012) including tree planting and hedgerows in historically
appropriate locations and the creation of green spaces, including those linking green
infrastructure and providing for safe and secure pedestrian and cycle routes that should be
integrated into the development proposals.
Within this green infrastructure framework, specific landscape mitigation shall be provided
in accordance with the recommendations of the Heritage Impact Assessment (CEC 2016)
the details of which are to be further developed through the preparation and adoption of a
Design Brief and via the Masterplan and Design Code for the site. These key elements of
mitigation as set out in the Heritage Impact Assessment (CEC 2016) entail the following:
i.
ii.

iii.
iv.
v.

vi.

c.

d.

Provision of sufficient areas of open space to the south and east of Hollyhedge
Farmhouse to maintain its open rural setting;
Provision of a substantial landscaped edge to the south/south east of the development
parcel immediately to the south of the railway line (on the opposite side of Main Road
to Hollyhedge Farm). This should combine a mix of copse and individual tree planting
contained by a new native hedgerow. At the point nearest Hollyhedge Farm in the
south eastern corner, a copse should be created. It should include woodland planting
on the western edge of the parcel, tying in with the woodland buffer of the Basford
East site;
Provision of open space and appropriate parkland landscaping alongside the
access/drive and to the south of Crewe Hall Farmhouse and associated barns;
Provision of an area of greenspace to the east of Stowford hamlet, retaining the existing
pond, trees and other positive planting as a key space within the development;
Reinstatement of historic shelter belt planting to define the edges of the former historic
parkland to the east of the access to the Crewe Hall Enterprise Centre, immediately
to the north of Old Park Road, and to the east of the entrance/access to Crewe Hall
Farm. The detail of the shelterbelt planting is to be based on compelling historical
evidence of the original planting scheme for the parkland; and
Parkland restoration of the parcel of agricultural land immediately to the north of
Stowford hamlet between the drive to Crewe Hall and the access to Crewe Hall
Enterprise Centre (immediately to the west of the South Cheshire Growth Village site).
The detail of this should be based on compelling historical evidence of the parkland
planting scheme.

The development will be expected to provide contributions towards education provision and
provide key linkages through to a school to be provided at Basford East, along with the
wider Basford East area. This should include both pedestrian and cycle links.
The development should be comprehensively masterplanned with a detailed design code
to ensure the following:
i.
ii.

iii.

The creation of appropriate linkages and connectivity between this site and Basford
East, Crewe town centre and railway station and the M6;
A high quality of development is secured by ensuring that new development is
appropriately located, and is of an appropriate density and scale in its relationship to
heritage assets, including their setting, principally the grade I listed Crewe Hall, the
registered park and garden at Crewe Hall, Hollyhedge Farmhouse and other groups
of listed buildings to minimise the impact upon the heritage assets;
To ensure the development relates appropriately to its wider context and the wider
setting of the heritage assets, including consideration of key views into and out of the
site, landform, key approaches into the site and the wider landscape character of the
countryside; and

The character of the two distinct areas should be maintained, i.e. the parkland character
should be enhanced within the historic parkland of Crewe Hall to the north of Old Park
Road (including the registered park) and the agricultural landscape to the south of the
parkland should be reinforced. This should be based on compelling historical evidence.

As an integral part of formulating the development brief, Masterplan and Design Code, a
full assessment of the significance of the heritage assets and their setting that are affected
by the South Cheshire Growth Village development will need to be undertaken, and the
findings of the assessment should be reflected in the development brief, masterplan and
design requirements set out in the Design Code.
Improvements to existing and provision of new pedestrian and cycle links to new and existing
residential and employment areas, shops, schools and health facilities.
Contributions to improvements to existing and the provision of new public transport links to
Crewe Railway Station, Crewe town centre and local villages.
The Local Plan Strategy Site will provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
The land within the registered park and garden of Crewe Hall and the Green Belt will be
excluded from the site boundary but appropriate specific landscape mitigation measures,
as set out in the Heritage Impact Assessment (CEC, 2016) will be required outside of the
site boundary.
On site provision, or where appropriate, relevant contributions towards education, health,
green infrastructure, open space and community facilities.
The development would be expected to contribute towards and / or facilitate road
infrastructure improvements in the area, including, A500 link capacity improvements, A5020
Weston Road junction and junction 16 of the M6.
Potential for self build and adaptable units to be incorporated into the masterplan and design
code for the site.
An appropriately designed green buffer will be provided between the site and the village of
Weston.
The area has a 'typical' Cheshire Landscape, characterised by a flat topography broken up
by a dense network of field hedges interspersed with mature hedgerow trees. The
development must respond to this sensitive landscape setting.
Pre-determination cultural heritage desk based assessment is required, to determine the
need for further evaluation and any mitigation that will be required.
Future masterplanning must ensure that connectivity for pedestrians and cyclists is
maximised and that high quality cycle and pedestrian links are provided to the adjacent
mixed use site of Basford East, including the new primary school.
Financial contributions will be required towards the provision of a new primary school on
the nearby Basford East site LPS 2.
Provision of habitat for protected species, if required.
Noise and air quality assessments, if required, relating to the railway and main roads passing
through or adjoining the site.

Justification
15.127 The allocation proposes a new sustainable village which provides distinctive new housing
in a high quality landscape setting. Existing woodland and vernacular estate architecture set the tone
for the creation of new residential community which compliments the current housing offer in Crewe.
The site will help meet the needs of Crewe's growing population and labour force demand, to support
the retention and growth of a highly skilled workforce.
15.128 The provision of this site will support growth in Crewe and the aspirations of the Northern
Gateway in improving local infrastructure, reducing the loss of skilled people to other areas and
increasing local expenditure on goods and services leading to further jobs being created. The South

15.129 This site will be able to take advantage of the interchange planned at Crewe for the current
preferred route for the High Speed Rail 2 network. The council will work in partnership with the Duchy
of Lancaster, the Highways Agency, Environment Agency and other statutory consultees to deliver
improvements to the A500.
15.130 The site has good accessibility to the M6 via the A500, which will be improved by the Crewe
Green Link Road. The council will work in partnership with the Duchy of Lancaster, the Highways
Agency, Environment Agency and other statutory consultees to deliver improvements to the A500.
15.131 The provision of new and the improvement of existing green infrastructure are of paramount
importance. This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents, as well as enhancing
the environment of the town and reflects the findings of the Green Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe
(TEP, 2012) and will also help deliver the aspirations of Northern Gateway.
15.132 A new pedestrian and cycle link will be created to Basford East. This must provide a safe
and secure environment for children to travel to school. Priority should be given to a route on the
north of the Railway line, combined with a cycle / footbridge. Only if after thorough exploration a
northern route proves unfeasible, will an access south of the railway be permitted. This could take
the form of an all-weather lit route. No vehicular link to Basford East will be permitted.
15.133 The future development brief, masterplanning and design coding must be informed by a
full 'assessment of significance' as required by the NPPF as well as by the recommendations in the
Heritage Impact Assessment (CEC, 2016). This must assess the significance of the heritage assets
and their settings and seek to minimise the impact of the development upon the historic environment
by delivering high quality design and mitigation as set out in this policy. It is extremely important that

high quality development, with a strong sense of place is secured, hence the requirement for a
development brief, masterplan and comprehensive design code.
15.134 Adjacent land lies within the Green Gap and Green Belt, along with the grade I listed Crewe
Hall and registered park and garden (grade II and on the Heritage at Risk Register). It is important
that the visual impact of development on these areas is minimised by appropriate landscaping,
parkland restoration and the retention of existing trees and hedgerows. The area south of the village,
either side of Main Road, Weston, is particularly sensitive, including its relationship to Hollyhedge
Farmhouse a grade II* listed building, and its setting. The land retained around Hollyhedge Farmhouse
(as defined in the Heritage Impact Assessment CEC 2016) shall remain undeveloped. A high quality
landscape scheme, with appropriate, strong planting on the boundaries of the development and
substantial areas of open space should be provided in the vicinity of Hollyhedge Farmhouse, to reduce
the impact of the development upon its setting.
15.135 It is important that this site contributes to highway network improvements, to ensure highway
network improvements, to ensure highway safety and deliver the aspirations of the Northern Gateway.
15.136 The area of protected open space is located within the Green Belt. As well as providing for
open space and recreation to meet the needs of the village, it will be accompanied by supporting
facilities compatible with Green Belt Status. The detailed boundaries of the Green Gap will be reviewed
and could further assist in separating the Village from Weston.
15.137 An archaeological assessment will be required, to understand the impact on undesignated
heritage assets and to minimise or mitigate harm. This should be informed by consultation with the
Local Authority's archaeological advisers.

The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
The site will be developed only where it can be demonstrated that there is no adverse impact
on the West Midlands Mosses SAC, Midland Meres and Mosses Phase 1 Ramsar and
Wybunbury Moss SSSI particularly in relation to changes in water levels and quality, with
reference to the Diffuse Water Pollution Plan for the site, and recreational pressures. This
should include a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct and indirect impacts of the
development on the features of special interest. Where impacts cannot be avoided,
appropriate mitigation measures will be required to ensure no adverse effects on the integrity
of sites.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

Justification
15.142 An outline planning application for up to 360 dwellings on the site has been granted on
23/01/12 including a legal agreement (12/3114N). This application included a Habitats Regulations
Assessment which considered the impact of the proposal on Wybunbury Moss Special Area of
Conservation and Ramsar site. A Reserved Matters application has been granted for 200 dwellings
on 11/12/14 on part of the site (14/3039N).
15.143 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents, as
well as enhancing the environment of the town and reflects the findings of the Green Infrastructure

High Growth City’.
15.144 The Wybunbury Moss Special Area of Conservation and Ramsar site lie within close
proximity of this site. It is important that this site contributes towards habitat improvements at
Wybunbury Moss. The provision of green infrastructure, open space and SuDS should reduce any
potential impacts on European designated sites
15.145 The existing landscape includes some hedgerows and hedgerow trees of landscape value.
Two ponds and a watercourse are also present on the site. All these features should be conserved,
utilised and extended as part of the landscape framework and green infrastructure proposals within
the development.
15.146 Contributions are required to be made for improvements to public transport, highways and
education.
15.147 It is important that cycle and pedestrian links between the site and nearby residential and
employment areas are provided, to integrate the site within the area and ensure sustainability.
15.148 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green infrastructure
and open space proposals should be submitted to the council during any future planning application
process on this site as part of sustainable development proposals and their proximity to European
site (consisting of either Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and / or Ramsar
sites).

15.150 The council expects that the following are considered in the context of the ecological value
of the site due to its proximity to a European site (consisting of either a Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas and / or Ramsar site):
Impact on natural hydrological function, pathways, groundwater and surface water
Impact on recharge to groundwater and consequent impact on site
Impact on water resources
Impact on water chemistry
Impacts on nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils and fuels)
Risks from misconnections, misuse of garden chemicals
Impacts from changes to air quality from construction and ‘end use’ traffic emissions resulting
in potential for increased nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during the construction work
Impact of increased foot traffic on the sensitive fen meadow vegetation
15.151 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.

15.168 Mud snail (a Local Biodiversity Action Plan priority species), lesser silver diving beetle (a
protected species) and great crested newts (a protected species) have been recorded from a number
of ponds and ditches on this site. Lesser silver diving beetles are dependent upon livestock poaching
of the pond edges to maintain the habitat in a suitable condition therefore areas of retained habitat
around the ponds must be of sufficient size to allow light grazing to be undertaken. The provision of
additional ponds either on-site or off-site within an area of suitable grazed agricultural land is required
to provide additional mitigation for the potential cumulative impacts on this species. Grass snakes (a
protected species) are also known to be present in the broad locality. Other protected species are
also thought to be present on the site. It is important therefore that appropriate habitat for protected
species, if required, is retained/provided within the site.
15.169 It is important that appropriate buffering planting, along the northern and eastern boundaries
of the site, is provided in such a way that a clear edge to the development is provided and that visual

facilities;
13. On site provision, or where appropriate, relevant contributions towards highways and
transport, education, health, open space and community facilities;
14. Highway improvements to Cumberland Street corridor and Hibel Road, Flower Pot junction
and Broken Cross junction or as determined through any future transport study;
15. Improved strategic highways links towards the north and Manchester on the A523 corridor,
including Poynton Relief Road;
16. Maximising opportunities to bring disused and underused buildings back into use; and
17. The provision of high quality design is of paramount importance, as this site includes
numerous listed buildings, four conservation areas and locally important buildings and
spaces. Development should have regard to the need to conserve and enhance the character
and appearance of the listed buildings and conservation areas, including their settings.

The overriding objective is to create a quality of life and urban environment which is attractive
for all those who want to live, work and shop in Macclesfield. To do this the focus must be
on offering increased high quality retail provision, a varied and interesting entertainment
centre, a mix of residential accommodation and high quality commercial space.
Retail and leisure sectors must be strengthened.
Macclesfield Railway Station is very well connected with frequent trains to London and
Manchester. In light of this connectivity there is a significant opportunity to create a ‘hub’
of activity built around the station with commercial, residential and leisure development.
Land immediately to the south of Hibel Road (A537) is ‘wedged’ between the retail core
and northern inner ring road. The area is small-scale and intimate with some attractive
buildings but could benefit from enlivening via small scale development and reintegration
with the town centre.
Sensitive infill residential development will be appropriate around Macclesfield’s historic
centre. Furthermore there are numerous opportunities to rationalise and consolidate existing
car parks – in so doing ‘unlocking’ important regeneration opportunities.
There are opportunities to deliver high quality public open space throughout the town centre,
most notably on Park Lane / Park Green. Allied with this, pedestrian activity and linkages
must take preference over vehicular activity. These pedestrian routes should be safe, secure,
accessible and well lit.
The encouragement of landmark developments of a high quality design that should respond
to local heritage and contemporary buildings.
The Macclesfield Area of Archaeological Potential lies within the Central Macclesfield area.
Archaeological assessments of development areas will be required, to include provision for
mitigation if required.
Depending on the location within the town, a cultural heritage desk based assessment of
the development proposals will be required; proposals should demonstrate that they will
conserve and enhance the character and appearance of the listed buildings and conservation
areas, including their settings and also show how regard has been paid to the impact of
development proposals on the heritage of the town.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

Justification
15.182 Central Macclesfield presents a valuable opportunity to maximise the assets and enhance
the character of Macclesfield town centre and central area.
15.183 This area contains a number of heritage assets and locally important buildings and spaces.
It is particularly important these buildings, places and spaces are retained and the local heritage is
considered in any new developments.
15.184 The delivery of new residential development within this central area will help to support and
enhance the town centre, improving natural surveillance in the area and supporting the night time
economy. It will also help to maintain a balance of uses within the area, that will help to create and
support sustainable communities.
15.185 High quality public spaces will support the vitality of this area and help to create successful
urban environments. Whilst the improved pedestrian and cycle links will increase footfall through this

Site LPS 13: South Macclesfield Development Area
15.187 The South Macclesfield Development Area is a large, predominantly greenfield site adjacent
to the southern urban edge of Macclesfield, bounded by Congleton Road (A536) and the railway line.
Much of this site consists of open fields and scrub land with hedgerow boundaries but there are some
existing uses on site such as small business uses off Turf Lane, a depot and playing fields with
changing rooms.
15.188 Adjacent neighbouring uses include one and two storey residential properties on Congleton
Road (A536) and recent new residential development off Moss Lane. The eastern boundary runs
along the rail line and opposite Lyme Green Business Park. The southern boundary is onto farm land
and the council’s waste recycling centre and Danes Moss Landfill Site.
15.189 The site offers the opportunity to create a sustainable urban extension to facilitate some
growth in Macclesfield; providing new housing alongside employment, convenience retail, community,
recreation and sporting facilities as well as green infrastructure and an important contribution to the
new link road.

The north / north-east portion of the site is most suitable for residential development.
Proposals should take account of the scale, massing and density of the existing adjacent
properties and access should be taken from the new link road. Site layouts should preserve
the amenity of existing properties.
The site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy requirements set
out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes';
Commercial, convenience retail and leisure development will be appropriate on the western
end of the site.
The south-east part of the site provides an excellent opportunity for the provision of a new
stadium facility for Macclesfield Town Football Club. There would also be an opportunity,
to the west of the Stadium, to provide training facilities along with car parking which could
serve the whole site.
The form of development should endeavour to retain, where appropriate, much of the
existing tree cover which is present on site – in particular on the southern boundary.
Pedestrian and cycle links to existing routes and the proposed parcels of development
should be provided, set within greenways which are safe, attractive and comfortable for
users.
A desk based archaeological assessment is required for the site, with appropriate mitigation
being carried out, if required.
A detailed site-specific flood risk assessment should be prepared.
The retention and/or replacement of the indoor and outdoor sports facilities should be in
accordance with the findings of an adopted, up to date and robust needs assessment.
The site will be developed only where it can be demonstrated that there is no significant
harm on the Danes Moss SSSI, particularly in relation to changes in water levels and quality,
species populations and recreational pressures. This should include a full assessment of
the direct and indirect impacts of the development on the features of special interest. Where
impacts after mitigation cannot be avoided, development proposals will not be permitted.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

Justification
15.190 This site has been allocated for a mix of uses including employment and shopping purposes
since 1997, but has not come forward for development due to a combination of site conditions, market
demand and competition pressures from other employment locations within the borough.
15.191 A mixed use allocation including a number of higher-value land uses including residential
and Class A1 convenience retail is therefore considered to be crucial in enabling this site to come
forward for development within the plan period.
15.192 Residential development will play a key role in achieving development on this site but the
density of the proposals will need to be carefully balanced so as to achieve viability whilst ensuring
the development is of a sustainable and high quality design that will be in keeping with the semi rural
character of this particular area.
15.193 Due to the scale of the development and its location on the urban fringe the retention of
large areas of open space and play facilities across the site will be considered important for recreation
purposes.

15.194 The site has been subject to a long-standing allocation for Class A1 retailing since 1997
(subsequently carried forward in the 2004 Local Plan Update) with the South Macclesfield Development
Area Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG – adopted November 1998) identifying that a Class
A1 food superstore with a net sales area of 2,787 square metres (30,000 sq. ft.) would be appropriate.
15.195
The 2011 Town Centres Study identifies that there is a significant under-supply of
convenience goods floorspace in Macclesfield with existing large out-of-centre superstores identified
to be significantly overtrading. Even taking account of planned commitments, a significant quantitative
and qualitative based need is identified by the study for a new Class A1 superstore in the town to
re-distribute trade whilst enhancing genuine competition and choice for local residents.
15.196 A new Class A1 superstore on the site would therefore realise the long-standing Local Plan
allocation and address the current spatial deficiency in main food shopping provision in the south of
Macclesfield. The store would meet a ‘location-specific’ need and serve the planned new residential
development as well as encouraging sustainable convenience shopping patterns.
15.197 Given the planned regeneration of Macclesfield town centre, it is important that the proposed
Class A1 superstore predominantly meets convenience shopping needs and the council will seek to
control the quantum of non-food retail floorspace via appropriate planning conditions.
15.198 The socio-economic profile of south Macclesfield suggests that there are pockets within
this part of the town which are most likely to suffer from deprivation. The allocation of employment
land within this site will help to improve access to employment opportunities for local residents and
also contribute to the town's overall employment needs.
15.199 The site is in close proximity to the Danes Moss SSSI and any new development will need
to be respectful of this fact. The council will expect all existing landscape features to be retained,
where possible, as well as the retention of any trees subject of a Tree Preservation Order unless
there are exceptional circumstances for their removal. An extensive network of green infrastructure
will be required on site, particularly to the south in order to integrate the site successfully into the area

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

and to help mitigate any impacts on the SSSI. A comprehensive landscaping scheme will be required
to soften the urban edge and ensure the site responds positively to the character and appearance of
this area as well as providing an appropriate buffer between the built form and the SSSI. Dependant
on the layout of the site a structural landscape buffer with appropriate planting may also be considered
necessary adjacent to the railway line in order to assist mitigation of noise.
15.200 The site has also been identified as a site having ecological potential. A more detailed
consideration should be given to this through the submission of an ecological survey and incorporation
of mitigation measures.
15.201 The site will be served by a new link road between Congleton Road (A536) and London
Road (A523). The road will be constructed in a phased manner, proportionate to the development of
adjacent housing, retailing and business. The development of the eastern portion of the site will
require completion of the link road to London Road. No development is expected to be served from
the existing road network to the north.
15.202 Appropriate off and on site highway works will be necessary to enable sustainable linkages
between the site and the town centre without exacerbating current traffic congestion pressures. The
council will expect cycle and pedestrian routes to ensure sustainable modes of transport are
encouraged.
15.203 Due to the scale of this development and sensitive constraints, a master plan should be
submitted so the site may be planned in a co-ordinated and comprehensive manner.
15.204 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

15.205 The council expects that the following are considered in the context of the ecological value
of the site due to its proximity to the Danes Moss SSSI:

230

Impact on natural hydrological function, pathways, groundwater and surface water
Impact on recharge to groundwater and consequent impact on site
Impact on water resources
Impact on water chemistry
Impacts on nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils and fuels)
Impacts from changes to air quality from construction and ‘end use’ traffic emissions resulting
in potential for increased nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during the construction work
Impact of increased foot traffic on the sensitive fen meadow vegetation
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that employment land will be delivered during the middle part of the plan period

15.206 This site is located to the east of Macclesfield, between the current urban area and the
Macclesfield Canal. Part of the site is currently occupied by the King's School and the site also includes
areas of agricultural land. Overall, it covers an area of approximately 13 hectares. Adjacent land
uses include the Fence Avenue Industrial Estate and residential areas. The Macclesfield Canal
bounds the south-eastern end of the site.
15.207 This site presents a suitable opportunity for the delivery of a sustainable and high quality
residential development in a central and accessible location.
15.208 Part of the site is within the Buxton Road Conservation Area and the Macclesfield Canal
Conservation Area. Allocation of this site involved an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.

Incorporation of green infrastructure throughout the site, to include an appropriate level of
open space provision; an area adjacent to the canal shall be retained as open space
encompassing land either side of the Smyth’s Bridge; this will retain some of the naturalised
setting, including the belt of tree planting to the west of the bridge (in order to minimise
impact on the conservation area and landscape designation area);
Improvement of existing and provision of new pedestrian and cycle links to existing residential
areas, shops, schools and health facilities; in particular, improvements to the canal towpath;

Public realm provision must play a critical part of any proposals, reflecting the green
credentials of the site. These spaces will need to be safe and secure and appropriately
managed.
Proposals should retain the main school building which faces onto Fence Avenue.
Green infrastructure provision should be prioritised throughout the site. It must connect with
the town centre by providing links to the bottom of Hurdsfield Road and Fence Avenue to
link to Victoria Park and also to the eastern edge of the site which provides connectivity
with the wider Green Belt and open countryside. Existing trees and hedgerows should be
retained where possible as these make a valuable contribution to the character of the area,
and its relationship with surrounding land uses. The scale and design of new development
therefore needs to reflect the urban fringe character at the edges of the site and green
infrastructure also needs to permeate from the edges into the main body of the site.
The Macclesfield Canal, which frames the southern portion of the site, provides an excellent
opportunity for improved permeability and connectivity with any proposed development and
also for enhancement of the public right of way. The development provides the opportunity
to enhance the usability of the canal and connectivity of the site to it through connection to
the towpath via Smyth’s Bridge, bringing it back into positive use.
The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes;.
Transport improvements as determined through any future transport study.
Retention (or replacement) and enhancement of playing fields and sporting facilities are
required as part of the development. The retention and/or replacement of the indoor and
outdoor sports facilities should be in accordance with the findings of an adopted, up to date
and robust needs assessment.
The setting of the Church of the Holy Trinity should be protected by excluding the elevated
land directly opposite the church from development (i.e. retaining it as open green
space/pasture) and maintaining the quality and density of landscaping on the eastern edge
of the site, including retention of existing tree belts and hedges. The identifiable tree line
along the eastern edge of the site should be strengthened by additional planting to form a
strong Green Belt boundary.
Any application would need to be supported by a full ecological appraisal, including a detailed
botanical survey of the grassland habitats on site. Mitigation would be required to address
any impacts on protected species. Any woodland, priority habitats or habitats of local wildlife
site quality on the site should be retained.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

Figure 15.16 Land East of Fence Avenue Site

15.209 Located to the north of Buxton Road and within 500m of Macclesfield town centre, this site
presents itself as a very sustainable location as it is within easy walking distance of local amenities
(shops / library) and public transport provision (bus stops, train station).
15.210 The site is one of two sites currently occupied by The King's School who are seeking to
consolidate existing operations into one site. The council intends to identify a new site for The King's
School through its Site Allocations Development Plan Document. This has the benefits of releasing
central, sustainably-located sites for development and will enable improved school and sporting
facilities to be developed.
15.211 The Fence Avenue site includes a main school building and a series of ancillary buildings
to the east. The main school building dates back to 1909 and although not listed it is considered to
be of architectural merit and offers an important contribution to the character of the Buxton Road
Conservation Area, within which it is located. A sympathetic conversion of the existing building is
therefore required.
15.212 The remainder of the site consists of playing fields, farmland and a wooded valley and is
framed by the Macclesfield Canal. The main school building and western boundary of the site is
located within the Buxton Road Conservation Area and the eastern boundary runs parallel to the
Macclesfield Canal Conservation area.
15.213 The site sits adjacent to the Cheshire Green Belt to the east and it lies within an area
identified as the “Peak Park Fringe” within the Cheshire East: Local Landscape Designation Study
(2013). Any new development on this site must respect the landscape character of this particular
area, the openness of the adjacent Green Belt and have regard to Policy SE 15 'Green Infrastructure',
and landscape will therefore be important to ensuring the proposed development integrates well into
the character of this particular area.

The development would be expected to contribute towards off-site road infrastructure
improvements in the central and southern Macclesfield area.
Any development that would prejudice the future comprehensive development of the adjacent
safeguarded land will not be permitted (Site reference LPS 19).
The access road must be designed to serve any potential future development on the adjacent
safeguarded land and it must be of a standard to form part of any future South West
Macclesfield Link Road.
The development would be expected to provide improvements to existing and include the
provision of new pedestrian, cycle and public transport links to existing and proposed
residential and employment areas, shops, schools & health facilities. The provision of a
south west green route would link with existing north to south routes in the form of the
Macclesfield Canal and Middlewood Way.
The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
The development should deliver compensatory habitats on the site as required.
A desk based archaeological assessment is required for the site, with targeted evaluation
and appropriate mitigation being carried out, if required.
A landscaped buffer should be incorporated between development and the rear of properties
on Hillcrest Road.
Any application would need to be supported by a full ecological appraisal. Mitigation would
be required to address any impacts on protected species. Any woodland, orchards or other
priority habitats or habitats of local wildlife site quality on the site should be retained and
buffered by areas of open space/habitat creation.
Any development proposals must avoid any impacts on Local Wildlife Sites. This should
include indirect impacts resulting from changes in hydrology, hydrochemistry, air pollution
and recreational impacts.

15.218 Located to the south west of Macclesfield, the site is well connected to the exiting urban
edge of the settlement and well connected to the highways network in the southern part of the town.
15.219 Through delivery of 300 new homes and 10 ha of employment land the site will contribute
significantly to meeting the housing needs of the borough and the on going regeneration and growth
of Macclesfield. The release of Green Belt land in this location has been necessary to enable the
provision of sufficient housing land within the plan period and to allow the safeguarding of land for
the future growth of Macclesfield beyond the plan period (Site reference LPS 19).
15.220 The site comprises agricultural land with some important natural features including trees,
hedgerows and ponds and there are known to be protected species on site. Any development proposal
must avoid any impacts on Local Wildlife sites. Danes Moss SSSI lies within 1km to the south east
of the site. Any development proposal should consider the indirect impacts on the SSSI and Natural
England would be required to be consulted on any planning application.
15.221 The incorporation of green infrastructure, community facilities, pedestrian and cycle links
to new and existing residential areas and contributions to wider community needs and infrastructure
(in particular the highways network and the South West Macclesfield Link Road) will all ensure the
site is delivered in a way which integrates into the existing settlement and local landscape.

The development would be expected to contribute towards off-site road infrastructure
improvements in the central and western Macclesfield area.
Any development that would prejudice the future comprehensive development of the adjacent
safeguarded land will not be permitted (Site reference LPS 19).
The access road must be designed to serve any potential future development on the adjacent
safeguarded land and it must be of a standard to form part of any future South West
Macclesfield Link Road.
The development would be expected to provide improvements to existing and include the
provision of new pedestrian, cycle and public transport links to existing and proposed
residential and employment areas, shops, schools & health facilities. The provision of a
south west green route would link with existing north to south routes in the form of the
Macclesfield Canal and Middlewood Way.
The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
A desk based archaeological assessment is required for the site, with targeted evaluation
and appropriate mitigation being carried out, if required.
Any application would need to be supported by a full ecological appraisal. Mitigation would
be required to address any impacts on protected species. Any woodland, orchards and
other priority habitats or habitats of local wildlife site quality on the site should be retained
and buffered by areas of open space/habitat creation. A 30m undeveloped buffer must be
provided around the ancient woodland within and adjacent to the site at Cock Wood and
deliver complimentary and/or compensatory habitats on the site as required.
Any development proposals must avoid any impacts on Local Wildlife Sites. This should
include indirect impacts resulting from changes in hydrology, hydrochemistry, air pollution
and recreational impacts.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

15.225 Located to the west of Macclesfield, the site is well connected to the exiting urban edge of
the settlement and well connected to the highways network in the western part of the town.
15.226
Through delivery of 200 new homes the site will contribute significantly to meeting the
housing needs of the borough and the on going regeneration and growth of Macclesfield. The release
of Green Belt land in this location has been necessary to enable the provision of sufficient housing
land within the plan period and to link with the safeguarding of land for the future growth of Macclesfield
beyond the plan period (site reference LPS 19).
15.227 The site comprises agricultural land with some important natural features including trees,
hedgerows and ponds and there are known to be protected species on site. Any development proposal
must avoid any impacts on Local Wildlife sites.
15.228 The incorporation of green infrastructure, community facilities, pedestrian and cycle links
to new and existing residential areas and contributions to wider community needs and infrastructure
will all ensure the site is delivered in a way which integrates into the existing settlement and local
landscape.
15.229 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘ Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.

15.230 This area lies to the south of Macclesfield beyond the Lyme Green Business Park and
incorporating land to the north and south of Gaw End Lane. The site is mainly agricultural land,
adjacent to the Council Depot at the northern-eastern corner. Surrounding uses include Lyme Green
Business Park, residential uses and agricultural land.
15.231 Allocation of this site involved an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary. The new Green

Buffer zone of semi-natural habitats to be provided adjacent to the Macclesfield Canal SBI.
Development must be sensitive to the conservation area and listed structures / buildings.
The retention of open space on the western edge of the site would help safeguard the
immediate context from urbanising development up to the canal edge, where it would most
dramatically affect views and the sense of openness within the bend in the canal. Regarding
the setting of Toll Bar cottage the impact could be lessened in the approach taken to the
site’s planning, by retaining the mature boundary landscaping opposite the property and
also by using this south easterly part of the site as a pedestrian gateway into the scheme,
with associated open space.
This Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
The site will be developed only where it can be demonstrated that there is no significant
harm on the Danes Moss SSSI, particularly in relation to changes in water levels and quality
and recreational pressures. This should include a full assessment of the direct and indirect
impacts of the development on the features of special interest. Where impacts cannot be
avoided, appropriate mitigation measures will be required to ensure protection of the SSSI
Any application would need to be supported by a full ecological appraisal. Ecological
mitigation would be required to address any adverse impacts.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

15.232 The site is located to the south of Macclesfield, is well related to the existing highways
network and Lyme Green business park and its allocation required a revision to the Green Belt
boundary. The site has been identified to deliver some 300 dwellings.
15.233 The site is detached from the main urban area of Macclesfield; however it does have a
strong relationship to the business park at Lyme Green and good access to key services, facilities
and employment opportunities by a range of modes of transport. Due to a lack of constraints and
major infrastructure requirements the site is available for future development in the short term.
15.234 There are some natural features within the site which is adjacent to a Site of Biological
Importance and includes heritage assets within the Macclesfield Canal Conservation Area, notably
a listed canal bridge. Development must be sensitive to the conservation area and listed structures
/ buildings and any noise impact from adjacent land uses should be mitigated against.
15.235 It is essential that investment is delivered to improve public transport infrastructure, pedestrian
and cycle links and other appropriate improvements to enhance the sustainability of this location.
15.236 Any proposals should include a buffer zone of semi-natural habitats adjacent to the
Macclesfield Canal and SBI. The area of protected open space (as shown on the Figure 15.19) will
also act as a buffer to the woodland area of Rayswood Nature Reserve.
15.237 Through the protection of existing features and the provision of appropriate infrastructure
and services, development here can form a sustainable extension to Macclesfield supporting the
prosperity and vitality of the town through the plan period.
15.238 Development here relates well to Lyme Green Business Park and the highway network
within the southern area of Macclesfield town.

of the site due to its proximity to the Danes Moss SSSI:
Impact on natural hydrological function, pathways, groundwater and surface water
Impact on recharge to groundwater and consequent impact on site
Impact on water resources
Impact on water chemistry

15.243 Located to the west of Macclesfield, the site is well connected to the exiting urban edge of
the settlement.
15.244 Through delivery of around 150 new homes the site will contribute to meeting the housing
needs of the borough and the on going regeneration and growth of Macclesfield. The release of Green
Belt land in this location has been necessary to enable the provision of sufficient housing land within
the plan period but the amount of land released is limited to respect the important area between
Macclesfield and Henbury.
15.245 The site comprises agricultural land, with some important natural features including trees,
hedgerows and a large pond and marshy areas. However there are no specially identified natural
designations within the site and it does not contain any assets of heritage value.
15.246 The incorporation of green infrastructure, pedestrian and cycle links to new and existing
residential areas and contributions to wider community needs and infrastructure will create a
sustainable development.

Site LPS 20: White Moss Quarry, Alsager
15.255 The White Moss Quarry site is located to the west of Alsager and covers areas of the peat
and sand workings and associated aggregate recycling operations at White Moss. Although classed
as greenfield (as subject to restoration conditions), areas of land have been extensively disturbed by
mineral extraction. The remainder of the location is in agricultural use and contains a variety of
wooded areas, existing hedgerows and field systems, to be retained or incorporated into the proposed
scheme. It is proposed that development will be focused on the south eastern part of this location
allowing for the wider existing worked areas to be effectively restored.

Site LPS 20
White Moss Quarry, Alsager
The development of White Moss Quarry over the Local Plan Strategy period will be achieved
through:

2.

The provision of around 350 new homes in the plan period (at a density of between 25 and
35 dwellings per hectare);
The creation of a new local centre including:
i.
ii.

3.

Appropriate retail provision to meet local needs; and
A small scale community facility that will be capable of accommodating a variety of
uses.

The incorporation of green infrastructure, including:
i.

ii.
iii.
iv.
v.

A significant depth of native woodland and other semi-natural habitat screening along
all relevant boundaries to provide a buffer between the development and the M6 (at
least 40 metres) and to offset detrimental visual impact to the open countryside, along
with the creation of wildlife habitats, including those for protected species;
The retention, where possible, of important hedgerows that have a cumulative screening
impact on development and contribute to the habitat value of the site;
The creation of drainage ponds that have visual and habitat potential;
Open space including multi use games area, equipped children's play space and
facilities for teenagers; and
Open space provision to accommodate the need for enhanced or new indoor and
outdoor sports facilities to accommodate the additional demand from the housing.
Provision should be in accordance with an adopted up to date and robust Playing Pitch
Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy.

Site Specific Principles of Development
a.
b.
c.

d.
e.

f.

Ensure the delivery of a high quality and sustainable development which respects the
character of local landscape and delivers excellent urban and architectural design.
Provision of new access and highways improvements to the surrounding area.
Improvements to existing and the provision of new pedestrian and cycle links to connect
the site to Alsager town centre, existing and proposed residential areas, employment areas,
shops, schools and health facilities.
The development would be expected to contribute to improvements to existing and the
provision of new public transport links to Alsager town centre and local villages.
Development proposals would be expected to fully assess and mitigate any potential adverse
impacts in line with the policy requirements of Policy SE 12 'Pollution, Land Contamination
and Land Instability'.
Development would be expected to allow for full remediation and restoration of the worked
areas contributing to provision of green infrastructure.

Contributions to education and health infrastructure.
Proposals would need to demonstrate that any surviving peat and associated deposits do
not require further analysis or is not worthy of preservation on palaeoecological grounds.
If this could not be done, further archaeological and palaeoenvironmental work may be
required involving specialist palaeoenvironmental input.
The site will be developed only where it can be demonstrated that there is no adverse impact
on the Midland Meres and Mosses Phase 2 Ramsar and Oakhanger Moss SSSI, particularly
in relation to changes in water levels and quality and recreational pressures. This should
include a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct and indirect impacts of the
development on the features of special interest. Where impacts cannot be avoided,
appropriate avoidance mitigation measures will be required to ensure no adverse effects
on the integrity of sites.
A site specific Flood Risk Assessment should be prepared.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

15.256 The location consists of areas that have been subjected to mineral related development in
the form of peat and sand extraction for agricultural and horticultural purposes with associated
aggregate recycling operations. Remaining areas are in agricultural use and contain a variety of
wooded areas, existing hedgerows and field systems, to be retained and incorporated into the proposed
scheme.
15.257 The site offers the opportunity to deliver homes within close proximity to Alsager with
excellent access to the M6 corridor, employment opportunities at Radway Green Business Park,
incorporation of green infrastructure and extended access to existing services within Alsager. The
site would provide an extension to Alsager when joined with approved residential development on
adjacent land to the east, off Crewe Road.
15.258 A need for the provision of affordable housing, additional school places and a small local
centre and community facility has been identified and the integration of new pedestrian, cycle and
transport links. Development at White Moss Quarry will also support the vitality and viability of Alsager
town centre.
15.259 The site would make a valuable contribution to the overall housing need for the borough,
whilst contributing to the Local Plan Strategy Vision and Strategic Objectives to promote economic
prosperity, create sustainable communities and protect and enhance environmental quality, providing
the opportunity to bring forward the benefits of restoring land currently in use as a quarry.

15.261 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.262 The council expects that the following are considered in the context of the ecological value
of the site due to its proximity to a European site (consisting of either a Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas and/or Ramsar site):
Impact on natural hydrological function, pathways, groundwater and surface water
Impact on recharge to groundwater and consequent impact on site
Impact on water resources
Impact on water chemistry
Impacts on nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils and fuels)
Risks from misconnections, misuse of garden chemicals
Impacts from changes to air quality from construction and ‘end use’ traffic emissions resulting
in potential for increased nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during the construction work
Impact of increased foot traffic on the sensitive fen meadow vegetation
15.263 The site has planning permission, with a signed s106 Legal Agreement (planning application
ref 13/4132N), for a mix of uses including the provision of up to 350 residential dwellings.
15.264 The site has potential for contamination to be present, therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.

Figure 15.24 Twyfords and Cardway Site

Justification
15.267 This site is comprised of the former Twyfords Bathrooms headquarters and the premises
of Cardway Cartons; the sites are separated by a railway line in active use. It lies within the south
eastern part of Alsager with extensive road frontages onto both Crewe Road and Linley Lane. The

site is brownfield land within the built-up area of the town, and includes part of a dismantled railway.
There is a small portion of greenspace in the south of the site that forms part of an amenity greenspace
identified as A30 by the Open Spaces Assessment.
15.268 The site covers an area of approximately 31 hectares. There is good access to the site by
road from the town and the A50 and by public transport services along Crewe Road. The majority of
the site is currently developed with the predominant uses including warehousing, factory space
delivery areas and car parking for staff.
15.269 The Twyfords site has outline planning permission for 335 dwellings (planning application
ref 11/4109C). The Cardway site has outline permission for 110 dwellings (planning application ref
15/2101C), subject to the signing of a S106 Agreement.
15.270 Retention of existing modern office space is considered appropriate in order to maximise
the sustainable reuse of the site. However, paragraph 22 of the NPPF notes that planning policies
should avoid the long term protection of employment use where there is no reasonable prospect of
the site being used for that purpose. The Employment Land Review (2012) assessed the Twyfords
portion of the site. It recommended consideration of partial change of use, with the possible exception
of modern office development, whilst noting that the site is not in a modern industrial location.
15.271 The council would support retention of the valued trees in the north eastern corner of the
site. Full consideration of mitigation and management should be given to the impact on the footpaths
that border the site, and the amenity greenspace that falls within it.
15.272 Archaeological investigations will be required on the site due to the presence of Bronze
Age Barrow archaeological deposits to the north east of the site. Any necessary mitigation should be
put in place, and development should respect the presence of the barrow.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

15.273 The possibility of contamination resulting from the previous industrial use of the site must
be fully appraised and mitigation undertaken as necessary.

254

15.274 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.275 The council expects that the following are considered in the context of the ecological value
of the site due to its proximity to a European site (consisting of either a Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas, and/or Ramsar site):
Impact on natural hydrological function, pathways, groundwater and surface water
Impact on recharge to groundwater and consequent impact on site
Impact on water resources
Impact on water chemistry
Impacts on nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils and fuels)
Risks from misconnections, misuse of garden chemicals
Impacts from changes to air quality from construction and ‘end use’ traffic emissions resulting
in potential for increased nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during the construction work
Impact of increased foot traffic on the sensitive fen meadow vegetation
15.276 It has been identified through the Alsager Town Centre Supplementary Planning Document
that accessibility to and within the town centre for cyclists and pedestrians needs to be improved.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that employment land allocations in mixed use schemes will be phased in tandem
with the housing allocations. Where appropriate, the phased release of employment land will be

15.279 The site is located to the north west of Alsager and within the established urban area. It
covers an area of approximately 22 hectares. The site's oldest buildings date to the 1940s and were
built to accommodate munitions workers. The majority of buildings on the site date to the 1960s. The
site was occupied by the University since 1992, although the majority of their operations have now
relocated to Crewe. The site currently comprises various unused buildings. The sports hall, gymnasium,
changing rooms and playing fields remain in use, but will be provided in Crewe in coming years.
15.280 The site is bounded to the north and west by countryside; to the east by Hassall Road; and
to the south by Dunnocksfold Road.
15.281 The site was allocated for up to 150 dwellings in the Congleton Local Plan, as part of a
mixed-use allocation under Policy DP3A. It is the subject of a Development Brief SPD, which identifies
the potential for 300 homes. The site is subject to a planning application for 408 homes and sports
pitches (15/5222C).
15.282 The council will support the retention of existing hedges and trees, particularly those shielding
the sports pitches at the junction of Hassall Road and Dunnocksfold Road.
15.283 Focus should be given to the sustainable management of surface water on the site including
use of SuDS.
15.284 Situated adjacent to the corner of the existing settlement, the site presents an excellent
opportunity to contribute to housing stock in the area, whilst retaining and enhancing important leisure
facilities, forming a wider leisure hub linked to the adjacent school and Cheshire East Council Leisure
Centre.

15.291 Radway Green Brownfield is a well-established mixed-use employment area, offering office,
industrial and research, and development workspace. It is located to the south west of Alsager and
to the north east of junction 16 of the M6 motorway. Surrounding uses include employment and open
countryside.
15.292 The Employment Land Review identified the area adjacent to this site as well-established,
attractive to the logistics sector, and in a good commercial location. It recommended that the site
continue in employment use.
15.293 The council will support the incorporation of green infrastructure for the purposes of screening
and environmental improvement.
15.294 The possibility of contamination resulting from the industrial use of the site must be fully
appraised.
15.295 An archaeological assessment will be required, to ensure that there will not be an impact
on undesignated heritage assets. The Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF no. 13) is a non-designated
heritage asset recorded on the Cheshire Historic Environment Record (CHER 4122) and was
established in 1940 to produce .303 ammunition. Many of the extant buildings are visible on 1940s
RAF aerial photographs of the site held in the HER and therefore date to the Second World War.
Furthermore, these buildings continued in use into the equally significant Cold War period and some
of the later supporting buildings will date from this period.
15.296 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green infrastructure
and open space proposals should be submitted to the council during any future planning application

Justification
15.300 The site is located on the B5078 about 2 kilometres to the south west of Alsager and adjoins
the Radway Green Industrial Estate, a mature employment area developed in open countryside
around a munitions factory during the post war period.
15.301 The future development of the site is conditional upon contributions to highway infrastructure
improvements, notably an upgrading of junction 16 on the M6.

15.302 The incorporation of green infrastructure, notably trees and hedgerows, together with
sensitive design in terms of the scale and massing of any new structures, has the potential to mitigate
any potential adverse impacts on visual amenity from main public vantage points.
15.303 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in enhancing the environment of the local area and
improving the health and wellbeing of employees.
15.304 The principal access to the site will be via the existing Radway Green Road (B5078) where
there is the potential to provide a safe access with adequate highway capacity to serve a strategic
employment allocation of this scale. The access should also be constructed so as to facilitate access
to the wider Radway Green Site. A new access at this point will avoid conflict with the constrained
railway crossing and enhance the attractiveness and efficiency of the site as a whole. Further
improvements to the public transport network, together with new pedestrian/cycle links, will enhance
the site’s accessibility to Key/Local Service Centres and the principal rail hub at Crewe.
15.305 A total of 380 hectares of employment land is to be provided during the plan period up to
2030 and this has been informed by the Employment Land Review (2012). This site will make a
positive contribution to the employment land supply equation.
15.306 An archaeological assessment will be required, to ensure that there will not be an impact
on undesignated heritage assets.
15.307

Habitats for protected species, if required, will be provided.

15.308 The strategic importance of Radway Green and its location within the M6 Growth Corridor
from Birmingham to Manchester allows it to act as the key linkage between these major hubs and
the wider Cheshire economy, and provides the opportunity to retain key existing jobs and promote
economic growth and further diversification at the site. This is also supportive of the 'All Change for
Crewe; High Growth City' initiative for the delivery of economic growth along the M6 growth corridor.

in relation to changes in water levels and quality and recreational pressures. This should
include a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct and indirect impacts of the
development on the features of special interest. Where impacts cannot be avoided,
appropriate mitigation measures will be required to ensure no adverse effects on the integrity
of sites.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

Justification
15.315 The site is located on the B5077 to the south west of Alsager close to the Radway Green
Industrial Estate, a mature employment area developed in open countryside around a munitions
factory during the post war period.
15.316 The incorporation of green infrastructure, notably trees and hedgerows, together with
sensitive design in terms of the scale and massing of any new structures, has the potential to mitigate
any potential adverse impacts on visual amenity from main public vantage points. This will also assist
in enhancing the environment of the local area, and improving the health and wellbeing of employees.

15.317 The principal access to the site will be via the existing Crewe Road (B5077) where there
is the potential to provide a safe access with adequate highway capacity to serve a strategic
employment allocation of this scale. Further improvements to the public transport network, together
with new pedestrian/cycle links, will enhance the site’s accessibility to Key/Local Service Centres
and the principal rail hub at Crewe.
15.318 380 hectares of employment land is to be provided during the plan period up to 2030 and
this has been informed by the Employment Land Review (2012); this site will make a positive
contribution to the employment land supply equation.
15.319 An archaeological assessment will be required, to ensure that there will not be an impact
on undesignated heritage assets.
15.320

Habitats for protected species, if required, will be provided.

15.321 Part of the site is affected by flood risk (Valley Brook), and a Sequential Test has been
applied in line with national planning policy. Policy PG 6 'Spatial Distribution of Development' identifies
that an additional 40 hectares of employment land should be provided at Alsager. In the absence of
alternative, reasonably available sites within or immediately adjacent to Alsager for employment
development with a lower probability of flooding, the allocation of Radway Green North satisfies the
Sequential Test. Through a site specific Flood Risk Assessment, carried out to inform any planning
application proposal, it should be demonstrated that the proposed development would be safe from
fluvial flooding, and would not increase the risk of flooding elsewhere. As with any development
adjacent to a main river an undeveloped buffer zone, at least 8 metres wide (measured from the bank
top), alongside the whole extent of the watercourse, should be provided. Bank top is defined as the
point at which the bank meets normal land levels.
15.322 The buffer zone scheme shall be free from built development including lighting, domestic
gardens, formal landscaping, footpaths etc; and could form a vital part of green infrastructure provision.
The buffer zone would also serve the purpose of protecting the Brook from the adverse impacts of

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

any development, as there may be grass snakes present on this site and the Brook is likely to have
nature conservation value (in its own right and also potentially for grass snakes), and should be
retained.
15.323 The strategic importance of Radway Green and its location within the M6 Growth Corridor
from Birmingham to Manchester allows it to act as the key linkage between these major hubs and
the wider Cheshire economy and provides the opportunity to retain key existing jobs and promote
economic growth and further diversification at the site. This is also supportive of the 'All Change for
Crewe; High Growth City' initiative for the delivery of economic growth along the M6 growth corridor.
15.324 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.
15.325 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green infrastructure
and open space proposals should be submitted to the council during any future planning application
process on this site as part of sustainable development proposals.

Impact on natural hydrological function, pathways, groundwater and surface water
Impact on recharge to groundwater and consequent impact on site
Impact on water resources
Impact on water chemistry
Impacts on nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils and fuels)
Risks from misconnections, misuse of garden chemicals
Impacts from changes to air quality from construction and ‘end use’ traffic emissions resulting
in potential for increased nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during the construction work
Impact of increased foot traffic on the sensitive fen meadow vegetation
15.327 Any development proposal should take into consideration the policy requirements set out
in Policy CO 2 'Enabling Business Growth Through Transport Infrastructure', and the need to improve
sustainable travel options, particularly in the wider cross border context.

Figure 15.29 Congleton Town Map

15.329 The focus for Congleton over the Local Plan Strategy period will be that of high quality
employment led growth to accommodate the expansion of existing businesses and attract new
investment into the town. New housing is seen as important as part of a balanced and integrated
portfolio of development to support the town centre and ensure balanced and sustainable communities.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

15.330 At the heart of the development strategy for Congleton is the construction of the Congleton
Link Road. It will assist in meeting the objective of employment led growth as it will support:
The economic, physical and social regeneration of the town;
The opening up of new development sites in particular to improve access to Radnor Park Industrial
Estate and Congleton Business Park;
The reduction in existing town centre traffic and to facilitate town centre regeneration;
The improvement of strategic transport links across the borough;
The reduction in community severance along key town centre corridors;
The reduction in traffic related pollutants within the town especially on those areas declared Air
Quality Management Areas.

15.332 The Congleton Link Road received planning approval in June 2016 (15/4480C). To facilitate
this key public infrastructure, no development will be permitted on the land required for the delivery
of the link road. The council has also agreed a funding strategy at its Cabinet meeting of 14 June
2016. The link road will be funded from a number of sources and to facilitate the early delivery of the
link road and unlock the full extent of the adjacent allocations, the council intends to provide forward
funding to enable its construction. The approach is to secure financial contributions from development
unlocked by the link road including retrospective contributions should the road have already been
committed (as evidenced through a construction contract being let by the council) and / or completed
by the time that development is granted planning permission. The council will seek appropriate
contributions to the infrastructure requirements of individual sites as set out in policy requirements
and in line with Policy IN 1 'Infrastructure' and IN 2 'Developer Contributions'. This approach may be
superseded in the future through the adoption and implementation of a Community Infrastructure
Levy Charging Schedule.
15.333 The layout and extent of the sites to the north of Congleton have been informed by the
proposed route of the Congleton Link Road. The North Congleton Masterplan has been prepared to
inform the allocation of land and provide further guidance on the following sites:
Back Lane and Radnor Park (LPS 26);
Congleton Business Park (LPS 27);
Giantswood Lane South (LPS 28);
Giantswood Lane to Manchester Road (LPS 29);
Manchester Road to Macclesfield Road (LPS 30).
15.334 Figure 15.30 (below) highlights the land uses anticipated alongside the extent of the
Congleton Link Road.

15.331 The Congleton Link Road runs to the north of the town connecting the A534 Sandbach
Road to the A536 Macclesfield Road. As well as providing other benefits, it directly unlocks
considerable opportunities to create new homes, jobs, green infrastructure and other community
facilities to the north of the town. The link road is therefore necessary for land allocations to take
place.

15.336 The Back Lane and Radnor Park site to the northwest of the town is significant in scale
extending from Black Firs Lane and Chelford Road to the River Dane. It presents an opportunity to
establish a high quality extension to Radnor Park Trading Estate alongside prominent leisure and
recreational uses. Residential development will support the creation of this sustainable community
set in ample green space which supports existing wildlife areas and the River Dane which is a key
asset to the town. Key to this development will be the provision of the Congleton Link Road. The
Village Green at Back Lane will be retained and enhanced.
15.337 Surrounding uses include the Radnor Park Trading Estate, residential uses, playing fields,
open countryside, agricultural land, woodland and the River Dane.

The delivery of appropriate public transport links to connect with employment, housing and
retail / leisure uses in the town.
The provision of pedestrian and cycle routes to provide clear and safe links to surrounding
communities.
A desk-based archaeological assessment will be required for any future application on this
site.
The site will provide affordable housing in line with the policy requirements set out in Policy
SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
Future development should have reference to the River Dane Local Wildlife Site and Ancient
Woodland.
Future development should also have consideration to Policy SE 14 'Jodrell Bank'.
In order to ensure a sustainable, mixed use scheme is delivered on the site, the council will
require all housing proposals to demonstrate, through the execution of a s106 Agreement
or appropriate alternative, how the delivery of employment land as an extension to the
Radnor Park Trading Estate will be positively supported.
The visual, noise and pollution assessment of development should be undertaken with the
assumption that the link road is in situ and suitable screening / mitigation provided
accordingly. Noise and visual mitigation measures should be provided between future and
existing employment / residential areas. This could include separation distances, acoustic
fencing, earth mounding, tree planting and building orientation.
Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2
‘Indoor and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
Future development should provide an appropriate buffer with the Ancient Woodland along
the River Dane corridor.
Future development should provide an east to west greenway with pedestrian and cycle
links across the site linking together proposed and existing leisure uses, local retail and
other community facilities at this site with other sites to the north of Congleton. This should
include a footbridge over the River Dane for pedestrian / cycle use.
The Congleton Link Road will form the boundary for development; except for a single area
shown in Figure 15.31.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.
The proposed route of the Congleton Link Road is as shown in Figure 15.31. Development
should be undertaken with the assumption that the link road is in situ. The land required for
the construction and delivery of the Congleton Link Road will be safeguarded from
development.

Justification
The Congleton Link Road is the single largest infrastructure project the council has
15.338
undertaken to date. It is vital to the successful delivery of sites to the north of Congleton and to resolve
long-standing economic and environmental impacts arising from congestion in the town. The link
road will also improve connectivity across the borough and access to the M6. The council has
recognised that it may have to provide gap funding upfront in order to deliver the Congleton Link
Road. As the link road is an essential component in the delivery of sites to the north of Congleton,
the council will seek appropriate contributions towards the link road from development unlocked by
the link road. In the event that the road is committed (as evidenced through a construction contract
let by the council) and / or completed at the time or planning permission(s) being granted, the council
will seek appropriate contributions to the Congleton Link Road on a retrospective basis.

15.339 The council’s stated aims for the delivery of the sites to the north of Congleton are that they
should be delivered on a comprehensive basis in line with the North Congleton Masterplan. The site
cannot be comprehensively delivered without additional highways capacity provided by the proposed
Congleton Link Road and, as such, the council will seek to ensure appropriate contributions to the
Congleton Link Road. The council will be mindful of the costs of bringing the site forward in such
circumstances and will consider affordable housing provision, on a case by case basis, where it is
demonstrated through robust viability evidence that 30% affordable housing would render the
development of a site unviable (in line with paragraph 7 of LPS Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes').
The council’s expectation is the site is delivered on a comprehensive basis in the form of outline
planning application(s), in line with the North Congleton Masterplan, to secure appropriate contributions
towards the delivery of the Congleton Link Road and appropriate contributions to the infrastructure
requirements of individual sites as set out in policy requirements and in line with Policy IN 1
'Infrastructure' and IN 2 'Developer Contributions'. In the event that changing circumstances impact
on the sites / infrastructure delivery in line with the stated programme then the council will consider
measures as set out in Chapter 16 (Monitoring and Implementation) of the LPS, including the use of
its Compulsory Purchase Powers, in order for the stated objectives of the site to be met.

15.340 Future development should prioritise pedestrian and cyclist permeability and achieve a
green infrastructure network across the site to improve / integrate networks, and improve connectivity
and provide safe direct access to the town centre and surrounding areas.
15.341 Development should provide green links to the River Dane Local Wildlife Site. It should
promote the inclusion of areas of good quality open space, including natural and semi-natural habitat
and wildlife corridors, within the strategic master planning of this area, to promote and enhance its
biodiversity and nature conservation potential.

primary school is proposed off Back Lane. This will form a key focus for future community life. The
school should be designed either to allow convenient dual use for community events or with a stand
alone community facility.
15.343 Future development should avoid the functional floodplain and include SuDS, where possible,
to manage surface runoff and reduce the amount of surface water entering the combined network.
This should include a surface water drainage strategy to consider measures such as attenuation
ponds / detention basins and other measures. The provision of green and blue infrastructure will be
key to the future master planning of this site.
15.344 Average residential density should be 30 dwellings per hectare across the site. A varied
density profile across the site may be necessary in response to site characteristics including visual
sensitivity, topography, landform and the existing character of the site.

towards the delivery of the Congleton Link Road and appropriate contributions to the infrastructure
requirements of individual sites as set out in policy requirements and in line with Policy IN 1
'Infrastructure' and IN 2 'Developer Contributions'. In the event that changing circumstances impact
on the sites / infrastructure delivery in line with the stated programme then the council will consider
measures as set out in Chapter 16 (Monitoring and Implementation) of the LPS, including the use of
its Compulsory Purchase Powers, in order for the stated objectives of the site to be met.

Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that employment land allocations in mixed use schemes will be phased in tandem
with the housing allocations. Where appropriate, the phased release of employment land will be
secured through S106 agreements/obligations.

The Congleton Link Road is the single largest infrastructure project the council has
undertaken to date. It is vital to the successful delivery of sites to the north of Congleton and to resolve
long-standing economic and environmental impacts arising from congestion in the town. The link
road will also improve connectivity across the borough and access to the M6. The council has
recognised that it may have to provide gap funding upfront in order to deliver the Congleton Link
Road. As the link road is an essential component in the delivery of sites to the north of Congleton,
the council will seek appropriate contributions towards the link road from development unlocked by
the link road. In the event that the road is committed (as evidenced through a construction contract
let by the council) and / or completed at the time or planning permission(s) being granted, the council
will seek appropriate contributions to the Congleton Link Road on a retrospective basis.

15.368 Development should provide green links to the River Dane Local Wildlife Site. It should
promote the inclusion of areas of good quality open space, including natural and semi-natural habitat
and wildlife corridors, within the strategic master planning of this area, to promote and enhance its
biodiversity and nature conservation potential. Development of the site should include appropriate
landscaping to minimise visual intrusion in to the Dane Valley.
15.369 Future development should include SuDS,where possible, to manage surface runoff and
reduce the amount of surface water entering the combined network. This should include a surface
water drainage strategy to consider measures such as attenuation ponds / detention basins and other
measures. The provision of green and blue infrastructure is key to the future master planning of this
site.
15.370 A new primary school is proposed within the site. This is likely to serve a broad area across
the north of Congleton and will form a key focus for future community life. The school should be
designed either to allow convenient dual use for community events or with a stand alone community
facility. There is the opportunity to link the school with localised retailing.
15.371 Future development should consider a movement strategy and the importance of a green
infrastructure network across the site to improve and integrate networks and improve connectivity
and safe direct access to the town centre and surrounding areas.
15.372 Average residential density should be 30 dwellings per hectare across the site. A varied
density profile across the site may be necessary in response to site characteristics including visual
sensitivity, topography, landform and the existing character of the site.
15.373 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.

15.367 The council’s stated aims for the delivery of the sites to the north of Congleton are that they
should be delivered on a comprehensive basis in line with the North Congleton Masterplan. The site
cannot be comprehensively delivered without additional highways capacity provided by the proposed
Congleton Link Road and as such the council will seek to ensure appropriate contributions to the
Congleton Link Road. The council will be mindful of the costs of bringing the site forward in such
circumstances and will consider affordable housing provision, on a case by case basis, where it is
demonstrated through robust viability evidence that 30% affordable housing would render the
development of a site unviable in line with paragraph 7 of LPS Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'). The
council’s expectation is the site is delivered on a comprehensive basis in the form of outline planning

A desk-based archaeological assessment will be required for this site.
Development should maintain and enhance Congleton Bridleway 4 and Bridleway 1
(Lamberts Lane) and improve pedestrian connectivity across the site set in green
infrastructure and into the wider footpath network.
Future development should consider the use of SuDS to manage surface run off from the
site.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made; suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.
The Local Plan Strategy site will provide affordable housing in line with policy requirements
set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
The delivery of off-site highway measures including improvements to Albert Place / High
Street / Lawton Street junction.
The provision of electric vehicle infrastructure (charging points).
The provision of 2 no. quality bus stops on Canal Road.
The provision of a travel plan in line with Policy CO 4 of the Local Plan Strategy.
The retention, where possible, of hedgerows and trees and the inclusion of appropriate
planting and buffering along the boundaries of the site, to provide a clear edge to the
development and reduce the visual impact of the development on the surrounding
countryside.
Protected species have been recorded on and near the site, additional ecological surveys
and mitigation will be required on the site. New development will be expected to respect
any existing ecological constraints on site and where necessary provide appropriate
mitigation.
A buffer zone (at least 5 metres wide) should be provided alongside any watercourse running
through the site.

Justification
15.387 The site has outline planning permission for 220 dwellings (planning reference 13/3517C)
following the granting of planning permission at appeal on the 14th December 2015. Planning
application 13/3517C incorporates two sites;- at the Moorings for 38 dwellings (15/0505C) and 40
dwellings at Goldfinch Close (15/0001C) which now have reserved matters approval (for both
applications).
15.388 A Heritage Impact Assessment has been prepared for this site, on the request of Historic
England.
15.389 Protected species are known to be present on the site; it is important that appropriate habitat
for protected species, if required, is retained/provided within the site.
15.390 It is important that appropriate buffering planting, along the boundaries of the site, is provided
in such a way that a clear edge to the development is provided and that visual impacts are mitigated.
15.391 An archaeological assessment will be required, to ensure that there will not be an impact
on undesignated heritage assets.
15.392 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.

Site LPS 33: North Cheshire Growth Village, Handforth East
15.395 The North Cheshire Growth Village presents an opportunity to deliver a high quality,
comprehensively masterplanned new settlement, embodying sustainable development principles and
incorporating the highest quality of design to represent an exemplar sustainable community, contributing
to the identified housing, employment and infrastructure needs of the borough.
15.396 Situated at the northern edge of the borough, on the eastern side of Handforth, the site is
located off the A34 (Wilmslow-Handforth Bypass), is bordered to the north by the A555 (Manchester
Airport Eastern Link Road), shares a boundary (consisting of open countryside and a rugby and
cricket club) to the north and the east with Stockport Metropolitan Borough, and is bordered to the
south by open countryside, as well as being bordered to the west by residential, retail and industrial
development.
15.397 The site is generally level in parts and gently undulating elsewhere. It comprises of
predominantly low grade agricultural land with some ground cover from willow and hawthorn, with
some mature groups of hedgerow and tree cover to the south east of the site, as well as having
various ponds across the site, some of which support a community of great crested newts.
15.398 Areas of the site are in current use (MoD offices and Total Fitness) and there are pockets
of other built development across the site. A grade II listed building, Dairy House Farm, is located
within the site; footpaths and public rights of way traverse the site.
15.399 In order to deliver an exemplar sustainable new settlement which delivers all the infrastructure
and facilities required, a comprehensive masterplan for the entire site will be developed and supported
by a North Cheshire Growth Village Design Guide. These documents will be produced in collaboration
with stakeholders and, following full consultation, will be approved and adopted by the council to
guide development of the site.

High quality design must reflect and respect the character of the local built form (especially
in relation to the setting of listed buildings) and natural environment creating an attractive
place to live and work, appropriate to its location, through having a thorough understanding
of the site’s features and contributions they make to the local area. Development must be
in accordance with an approved and agreed comprehensive masterplan and North Cheshire
Growth Village Design Guide.
A delivery plan will be required showing the phasing of development and timing of provision
of the local centre and other community facilities and infrastructure. Supporting facilities
and infrastructure must be delivered as early as is feasible to emphasise the new settlement’s
sustainable credentials in its early years.
All new dwellings should aim to achieve a ‘Built for Life’ accreditation (or equivalent under
a comparable successor scheme) and where possible, dwellings should aim to achieve a
‘Built for Life Outstanding’ accreditation (or equivalent under a comparable successor
scheme).
The provision of apartments above the retail and other facilities in the local centre(s) should
be included in development proposals where feasible and viable.
Features of amenity value including mature trees, hedgerows and ponds must be retained
where possible.
Development proposals should take advantage of the existing topography and vegetation
on site where possible in order to minimise visual impacts on the surrounding landscape.
Significant planting and landscaping buffers must be provided at the eastern boundary to
define a readily recognisable, defensible and permanent new boundary to the Green Belt.
Existing public rights of way should be retained and appropriate pedestrian and cycle
linkages must be provided to improve connectivity and accessibility into and out of the site
to the wider local area, including improvements to the accessibility of Handforth Railway
Station and district centre.
Improvements must be made to other public transport provision, including where possible
direct access to bus services to Handforth district centre and beyond.
Allow for appropriate highway impact mitigation measures to the A34 and A555 corridors.
Site access is primarily to be taken from A34/ Coppice Way roundabout and A34 / Handforth
Dean Retail Park ‘dumbell’ junction. Both of these junctions are to be upgraded as part of
the development. Consideration should be given to provision of an additional access point
from the A555.
The development should retain important habitats and provide compensatory habitats for
great crested newts and other protected and priority species and habitats on the site. The
green corridors should be designed to support the preservation and enhancement of
biodiversity on the site.
A desk based archaeological assessment will be required to determine if any future
evaluation or mitigation will be needed.
Development must facilitate the preservation and refurbishment of the Grade II listed Dairy
House Farm.

Figure 15.39 North Cheshire Growth Village Site

Justification
15.401 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) advises that sustainable development
may be achieved through the allocation of new settlements with self contained facilities and providing
an opportunity to properly plan infrastructure to support new construction. This is best achieved
through the local planning process where a plan-led, co-ordinated approach can be achieved with
the early involvement of key stakeholders.
15.402 The case for an alternative future development option through the allocation of a major
mixed-use development at Handforth East was originally canvassed as part of the public consultation
on the Handforth Town Strategy.
15.403 The approach to delivering a new sustainable community adopted by the council, has been
favoured over the allocation of development sites in restricted, unsustainable locations having
constrained infrastructure and/or a lack of local services and facilities.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

15.404 A concept statement prepared for the site in July 2013 advised that the majority of the site
should be allocated for residential development and that densities should vary accordingly to reflect
the neighbouring environment and local character. Medium density would be appropriate on the
northern edge of the site whilst low density could be suitable on the eastern and southern edges,
reflecting the relationship with the open countryside.
15.405 The proposed commercial centre is intended to be in the north-west portion of the site to
take advantage of the existing primary vehicular access points which provide connectivity with
Handforth Dean and the A34. Similarly, a local centre, with a mixture of uses including small scale
retail, is intended to be provided close to the roundabout that provides a direct link to Handforth Dean
Retail Park whilst schools would be best located in the heart of the residential area. The precise
locations of uses will be determined through the comprehensive masterplan. The two form entry
primary school provision will be located on site. The secondary school provision to meet projected
needs from the site is predicted to be equivalent to 11.5 classrooms and proposals should consider
whether a new secondary school can also be accommodated on site.
15.406 The site access strategy has been informed by use of the highway model developed for
the A6MARR scheme and the primary site access will be from an upgraded A34/Coppice Way
roundabout and an upgraded A34/Handforth Dean Retail Park ‘dumbbell’ junction. Proposals should
investigate the possibility of including a complementary access point from the A555, which would
provide increased permeability through the site and deliver wider network benefits in terms of providing
an additional connection between the A555 and A34.

15.408 Landscape corridors should be provided throughout the site, not only for convenient
pedestrian and cycle leisure routes but also to link recreational spaces. Existing newt mitigation
features present on site should remain and be extended to allow wildlife to access foraging areas
through the use of ‘green fingers’ extending into, and beyond, the development. Regard should also
be had to the land safeguarded for potential future development adjacent to the site (site reference
LPS 35).
15.409 The proposed new sustainable community is considered to be in line with the social,
economic and environmental principles of sustainable development, allowing it to contribute to the
required housing, employment and infrastructure needs of the borough, whilst addressing policy
requirements taken as a whole within the Local Plan Strategy and meeting the requirements of the
NPPF.
15.410 To make sure that the North Cheshire Growth Village continues as an exemplar sustainable
community in the long term, future management, maintenance and ownership will be addressed from
the outset to include a local management organisation comprising representatives of the new
community and local authority to allow locally-based long term ownership and management of facilities
in perpetuity.
15.411 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘ Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities.
15.412 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

15.407
Given the site’s proximity to Handforth, Cheadle Hulme, Bramhall and surrounding
settlements, the townscape and vernacular should be considered to inform the character of the
development. High quality design should also be a priority and proposals must demonstrate that local
character has been respected whilst not compromising the quality of the environment.

15.413 The land between Clay Lane and Sagars Road presents an opportunity to deliver a high
quality, sustainable residential development to contribute to the identified housing requirement for
Handforth.

298

15.414 The site is located to the west of Handforth, bound by Clay Lane (track) to the west, and
Sagars Road (track) to the south. Whilst there is open countryside to the west and south, the site
adjoins residential development to the north and east. The site is generally flat.
15.415 There are a number of mature trees within and around the site, and the site is separated
from the adjoining housing areas by Dobbin Brook. At present, the site is not publicly-accessible and
has no footpaths running through it, although there are tracks to the west and south accessible to
the public.
15.416

Allocation of this site involved an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.

1.
2.

3.

The delivery of around 250 dwellings;
Provision of a direct cycle and pedestrian link from the site to the west to improve
connectivity. A link to the open space to the east should also be provided as part of any
development; and
Retention of trees and woodlands on the edges of the site, with new planting to re-enforce
important landscape features and to properly define a new Green Belt boundary.

a.
b.
c.
d.
e.

f.
g.
h.
i.

The development must be a high quality design which reflects and respects the character
of the area and the amenities of neighbouring properties.
Provide a comprehensive landscaping scheme which retains existing mature trees and
hedgerows particularly on the perimeter of the site.
Creation of a new vehicular access to the site of sufficient capacity to accommodate the
proposed development.
Improve the connectivity and accessibility into and out of the site to Handforth town centre
and the wider local area with the provision of cycle paths and pedestrian linkages.
Provision should be made for public open space, possibly utilising Dobbin Brook as a focus
for green infrastructure. Any new development will be expected to make contributions to
playing fields and children’s play facilities where these cannot be provided on site.
New development will be expected to respect any existing ecological constraints on site
and where necessary provide appropriate mitigation.
Provide contributions to health and education infrastructure.
The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.

Justification
15.417 The site offers excellent opportunities for a sustainable residential development which will
contribute to meeting Handforth’s housing requirements.
15.418 The site is reasonably well located to Handforth, with bus routes nearby and is within walking
distance to Handforth Railway Station and shopping centre. There is the opportunity for linkage to,
and improvement of, adjoining rights of way for pedestrians and cyclists.
15.419
With a quality design, the development of the site could respect the character and
distinctiveness of the locality with quality design. Green links could be created, improving local
connectivity and benefiting new residents as well as the wider area.
15.420 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.

Site LPS 36: North West Knutsford
15.429 North West Knutsford consists of 3 sites which, together, comprise areas of open countryside
adjacent to, playing fields, public rights of way, allotments and fishing ponds, limited areas of
employment and a number of listed buildings. The sites are adjacent to existing residential development
on the North West edge of Knutsford. They present an opportunity for high quality, sympathetic low
density residential development with community facilities and the creation of open space. Development
will integrate with existing facilities and communities and provide links to the settlements to the south
and east of the sites.
15.430 Surrounding land uses also include the Land Rover Car Sales Showroom, the Brookdale
Centre and Tatton Park.
15.431

Allocation of this site involved an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.

Site LPS 36
North West Knutsford
The development of North West Knutsford over the Local Plan Strategy period will be achieved
through:
1.

Phased provision of around 500 new homes and 7.5 hectares of high quality Class B1
business park development within the following sites:

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

LPS 36(A) Land North of Northwich Road (175 dwellings);

LPS 36(C) Land East of Manchester Road 250 dwellings;

304

It is anticipated that separate planning applications will deliver each of the above sites,
and with each site having independent access, this is acceptable. Collectively the sites
will deliver, as appropriate, the following provisions (2-6) and each planning application
will be assessed against the relevant site specific criteria (a-u) as they may apply to that
application site.

designated heritage assets, parkland and the character of the surrounding area. Development
adjacent to the Toll House on Northwich Road must be set back from the road by a buffer
zone of mature planting to mitigate the visual impact of development on the Toll House.
Proposals will be expected to include a Landscape Character Assessment to guide the
scale and massing of new development.
Provide a comprehensive landscaping scheme which retains existing mature trees and
hedgerows where possible, or provide appropriate mitigation.
Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up

Provision of high quality landscaping to enhance ecological features.
Provision of new woodland belts within the sites and to create site boundaries.
Contribute to road infrastructure in the area including roundabout improvements at the
junction of A50/Northwich Road and Canute Place and Improvement to the A50 Corridor.
Provision within LPS 36(A) and LPS 36(B) for a principal access road which, in the longer
term, would connect Northwich Road to Manchester Road and ensure connectivity within
the North West Knutsford sites.
An archaeological pre-determination evaluation will be required for these sites in addition
to a desk based archaeological assessment.
Any development that would prejudice the future comprehensive development of the adjacent
safeguarded land will not be permitted (site references LPS 39 / LPS 40).
The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the sites are, or could be made, suitable for use should they
be found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required
at a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the sites.
The sites will be developed only where it can be demonstrated that there is no adverse
impact on the Midland Meres and Mosses Phase 1 Ramsar, Rostherne Mere Ramsar and
Tatton Mere SSSI particularly in relation to changes in water levels and quality and
recreational pressures. This should include a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct
and indirect impacts of the development on the features of special interest. Where impacts
cannot be avoided, appropriate mitigation measures will be required to ensure no adverse
effects on the integrity of the sites.
The development of the new business park within Site LPS 36(B) should:
Be planned in a comprehensive way, with the adjacent housing development site;

Mereheath Lane and the eastern edge of built development on the site, each landscaped
belt to be a minimum of 15 metres wide and complementary to the landscape character
of the surrounding area; and
provide a suitable landscape screen within the area allocated for housing adjacent to
its eastern boundary with the ‘protected open space’. The details of this landscape
screen should be informed by the required Landscape Character Assessment and
provide appropriate mitigation as part of a comprehensive landscape scheme; and
include the provision of a wide landscaped belt on the Green Belt land to its northern
side, with an average width of around 100m to soften the transition between built
development and the adjacent open countryside and to respect the setting of Tatton
Park, its Registered Historic Park and Garden, and the visitor approach to Tatton; and
provide for the long-term future management of the informal open space and landscaped
belts.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Justification
15.432 North West Knutsford is largely made up of agricultural land, which directly adjoins residential
areas. Surrounding uses are both residential and commercial and therefore this area presents its self
as an ideal opportunity for a high quality, residential-led sustainable development, which will offer a
contribution to housing, employment and community requirements for a Key Service Centre.
15.433 The topography of this area is relatively flat and sits adjacent to Rostherne and Tatton
landscape designation. There are a number of designated heritage assets and Historic Parklands,
which are located within close proximity of the strategic sites and therefore new development will
need to be sensitively designed so as to be sympathetic to both the historic built form and surrounding
landscape.
15.434 A landscape and visual assessment will be fundamental in justifying the siting and massing
of development. The sites should also be masterplanned in order that there is a cohesive link between
these strategic sites and safeguarded land.
15.435 Green infrastructure, along with a comprehensive landscaping scheme will be essential to
these developments. Open space provision and additional woodland planting particularly along the
boundaries of the sites will ensure the development is in keeping with the character of the surrounding
landscape and will provide a defensible boundary to prevent encroachment into the Green Belt.
15.436 As with all new development, any ecological constraints should be considered and respected,
and where necessary the proposal should provide appropriate mitigation.

15.438 This particular area of Knutsford currently accommodates a number of sports and community
facilities, which provide a valuable contribution to the health and well being of the local community.
Contributions to the enhancement of existing facilities either on or off site will be expected.
15.439 New development will put increased pressure on existing community facilities and therefore,
on or off site contributions to local community facilities should also be secured in order to ensure the
sites are sustainable.
15.440 The council will require improvement works to existing highways infrastructure associated
with the development of these sites to accommodate the capacity and assist with the free flow of
traffic in and out of Knutsford town centre.
15.441 The council will require development of an appropriate scale and design; and will require
boundary treatments including retention of valued trees and hedgerows where possible, in order to
contain the development, provide habitat for local wildlife and respect the setting of Tatton Park
Estate.
15.442 The protection enhancement and some new provision of PROW, sports and leisure facilities
will be required in accordance with Policy SC 2 'Indoor and Outdoor Sports Facilities' in line with an
appropriate action plan.
15.443 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green infrastructure
and open space proposals should be submitted to the council during any future planning application
process on the sites as part of sustainable development proposals and their proximity to European
site (consisting of Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and / or Ramsar sites).
15.444 The council expects that the following are considered in the context of the ecological value
of the sites due to their proximity to a European site (consisting of a Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas and / or Ramsar site):
Impact on natural hydrological function, pathways, groundwater and surface water

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

15.437 Vehicular and pedestrian permeability as well as cycle linkages between the sites, town
centre and wider community facilities should be enhanced or created in order to ensure the integration
of the development and its sustainability into the existing community.

Impact on recharge to groundwater and consequent impact on sites
Impact on water resources
Impact on water chemistry
Impacts on nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage

Risks from misconnections, misuse of garden chemicals
Impacts from changes to air quality from construction and ‘end use’ traffic emissions resulting
in potential for increased nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during the construction work
Impact of increased foot traffic on the sensitive fen meadow vegetation
15.445 The sites have potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1
Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any
contamination that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

15.446 Site LPS 36(B) provides an opportunity to create a new high quality (Class B1) business
park development in this important gateway location to the town. To reflect this, and to ensure that
its development respects the wider open countryside setting of the town in this area, a high quality
of design is critical, including appropriate landscaping to the boundaries of the site. To achieve this
objective, the site will also be limited to Class B1 uses.

308

Site LPS 36(C) provides an opportunity to create a high quality, distinctive and
15.447
comprehensively planned new residential neighbourhood with associated community facilities. The
eastern-most part of the site is identified as protected informal open space. This enables new built
development to be set back from Mereheath Lane and allows for appropriate landscaping, in the
interests of protecting the setting of, and approach to, Tatton Park. The informal open space and
landscaped belts could accommodate sustainable drainage features and they provide an opportunity
to create new ecological habitats to provide net gains in biodiversity for the allocated site as a whole.
The opportunity should also be taken to provide managed, public access within the landscaped belt
to the north of the site. This landscaped belt can be created in the Green Belt along the northern
boundary of the site and will serve to strengthen the new Green Belt boundary.

Figure 15.44 Parkgate Extension Site

Justification
15.450 The land at Parkgate forms a logical extension to an existing residential and employment
area located adjacent to the settlement boundary north of Knutsford.
15.451 This whole site is outside the Green Belt having been allocated within the Macclesfield
Borough Local Plan 2004 as employment land. In order to facilitate the sustainable expansion of the
trading estate and contribute to economic growth, a mixed employment and housing scheme is
proposed. By virtue of its location and non Green Belt designation, it is considered that this site
presents a rare opportunity, within this part of the borough, for a sustainable development within the
existing settlement boundary of a Key Service Centre.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

15.452 This site is well contained by existing landscape features (woodland to the north and a
brook to the south) and borders the Tatton Mere SSSI and the Rostherne, Tatton Park Landscape
Designation. A landscape and visual assessment will therefore be essential to ensuring that new
development is designed sensitively having regard to the surrounding landscape, character of the
area and existing built form.
15.453 Green infrastructure provision will be essential to ensure the new development is well
integrated. New residential development should be situated to the north of the site to protect the
amenities of residential properties with the existing and proposed employment uses. Comprehensive
woodland buffers should also be secured to the boundary of Tatton Park Estate to the north and west
of the site and to the south adjacent to the existing and proposed employment land.
15.454 Existing mature trees and hedging will be expected to be maintained, where possible, or
replaced with mitigation. The floodplain of the Birkin Brook must be safeguarded.
15.455 A cohesive approach must be taken when considering the layout of the site, good connectivity
between existing and new developments and open space provision will be essential in ensuring a
well designed sustainable site. Noise mitigation must be incorporated between the industrial site and
the residential area in the form of a 50 metre standoff or acoustic bund / fence.
15.456 New development will also be expected to respect any existing ecological constraints on
site and where necessary, provide appropriate mitigation.

15.458 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green infrastructure
and open space proposals should be submitted to the council during any future planning application
process on this site as part of sustainable development proposals and their proximity to European
site (consisting of either Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and / or Ramsar
sites).
15.459 The council expects that the following are considered in the context of the ecological value
of the site due to its proximity to a European site (consisting of either a Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas and / or Ramsar site):
Impact on natural hydrological function, pathways, groundwater and surface water
Impact on recharge to groundwater and consequent impact on site
Impact on water resources
Impact on water chemistry
Impacts on nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage

Risks from misconnections, misuse of garden chemicals
Impacts from changes to air quality from construction and ‘end use’ traffic emissions resulting
in potential for increased nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during the construction work
Impact of increased foot traffic on the sensitive fen meadow vegetation

15.457 Improved access and infrastructure is considered to be key to ensuring the site's sustainability
and integration within the wider community. New access to the site off Parkgate Lane will be required
together with a new access to Mobberley Road, over or under the railway line. Section 106 contributions
will be sought to improve additional pressure to road networks within Knutsford and social infrastructure
to secure a sustainable form of development.

Financial contributions to the delivery of a Middlewich Eastern Bypass.
Relevant contributions towards highways and transport, education, health, open space and
community facilities.
The achievement of high quality urban and architectural design and the delivery of a high
quality public realm.
The provision of a network of open spaces for nature conservation and recreation which
reinforce connections to adjacent green infrastructure.
Contributions to education and health infrastructure.
The site will deliver excellent connections to existing residential areas and facilities within
Middlewich and within the site, including pedestrian, cycle and vehicular connection between
Booths Lane and Warmingham Lane.
A pre-determination desk based archaeological assessment will be required for the site.
The Local Plan Strategy Site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
The development proposals must be of a high standard and have a positive impact on the
various listed buildings, their character and appearance, including the setting of the Trent
and Mersey Canal Conservation Area.
Retention (or replacement) of the existing sport ground should be in accordance with the
findings of an adopted, up to date and robust needs assessment.

Justification
15.494 Glebe Farm presents an opportunity to deliver a high quality, sustainable residential
development whilst supporting the delivery of key infrastructure through financial contributions to the
Middlewich Eastern Link Road. The existing permission for 149 dwellings adjacent to the site at
Warmingham Lane enhance the ability of the site to achieve this.
15.495 The site is located toward the existing urban edge of Middlewich with a strong relationship
to the residential area to the north and contains a pond, trees and hedgerows within the site. To the
east of the site on the other side of Booth Lane lies the Trent and Mersey Canal conservation area,
which also includes the listed Rumps locks.
15.496 Existing green space adjacent to the north of the site offers an opportunity to fully integrate
and maximise green infrastructure within the new residential area whilst enhancing the urban
environment of the existing residential development to the north. Given the site's location at the south
western edge of the existing settlement, the provision of new infrastructure and facilities will ensure
future development is sustainable whilst the provision of strong pedestrian and cycle links to existing
residential and employment areas will support facilities elsewhere in the town.

Strategic Location LPS 43: Brooks Lane, Middlewich
15.499 The Brooks Lane Strategic Location is an area of around 23 hectares of land that is largely
used for employment purposes and includes unused and under used land. The site is around 0.5km
to the south of Middlewich town centre and as such is considered a sustainable location with
regeneration potential for an enhanced use that will benefit the town.
15.500 The site is well related to the existing urban area of Middlewich with excellent access to
services and facilities in the town centre and includes the Trent and Mersey canal and associated
conservation area within its boundary. The site's central position would make it an ideal location for
a new station in the town and it is important that this possibility is given serious consideration as part
of any future masterplanning for the redevelopment of the site.

Strategic Location LPS 43
Brooks Lane, Middlewich
The development at Brooks Lane over the Local Plan Strategy period will be achieved through
a masterplan led approach that will determine the precise nature and quantum of development
that is appropriate for the strategic location. The strategic location is likely to include:
The delivery of around 200 homes;
The delivery of leisure and community facilities to the north of the site;
The provision of appropriate retail facilities to meet local needs;
The incorporation of green infrastructure, including:
i.
ii.
5.

6.
7.

Green corridor; and
Open space including an equipped children's play space.

The improvement of existing and provision of new pedestrian and cycle links to connect
development to existing employment, residential areas, shops, schools, health facilities,
recreation and leisure opportunities and the town centre; and
The potential provision of a Marina at the Trent and Mersey Canal.
The provision of land for a new railway station including lineside infrastructure, access and
forecourt parking.

Site Specific Principles of Development
a.

b.

c.

d.
e.
f.
g.
h.

The masterplan will need to consider the constraints, such as the scheduled monument,
listed buildings and the Trent and Mersey Canal Conservation Area and their respective
settings, as well as the opportunities that the site provides including a new railway station
and marina.
Development should incorporate pedestrian and cycle links set within green infrastructure,
which connects and enhances links to existing employment, residential areas, shops,
schools, health facilities, recreation and leisure opportunities and the town centre.
The site will deliver enhancements to the Trent and Mersey canal corridor. The development
proposals adjoining the Trent and Mersey Canal Conservation Area and associated listed
buildings must reflect the location and be of a high standard.
On site provision of a network of open spaces for nature conservation and recreation.
Contributions towards public transport and highways improvements, including improvements
to the A54 through Middlewich.
Contributions towards education and health infrastructure.
Consideration of the impact on Cledford Lane Lime Beds Grade B Site of Biological
Importance that is located to the south of the site.
The site includes part of an area of archaeological potential and a scheduled monument.
To determine the contribution which this area makes to the significance of the scheduled
monument and other heritage assets future development proposals will be accompanied

by a pre-determination desk based archaeological assessment and Heritage Impact
Assessment.
The strategic location will provide affordable housing in line with the policy requirements
set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
Development should contribute to the long term conservation and enhancement of the
scheduled monument including opportunities for interpretation’.
Future policy development and the masterplanning of the site shall be informed by the
suggested mitigation set out in the HIA prepared by the council’s Heritage and Design Team
dated 19 September 2014.

Figure 15.51 Brooks Lane Strategic Location

Justification
15.501 The site is bounded by the Trent and Mersey Canal to the west, a residential area to the
north, the Sandbach to Northwich railway line to the east and British Salt settling lagoons to the south.
There is potential to expand the site into the salt lagoons in the future.
15.502 The development of this site will be expected to enhance the conservation area and its
setting, regenerate the part of the site close to the canal and bring significant benefits to the visitor
economy. Delivery of a mixed residential-led development in this location will ensure the provision
of new and enhanced green infrastructure, open spaces and pedestrian and cycle links through the
site, opening access to important heritage assets within the site for existing residents of the town and
new residents of the site.
15.503 The provision of land for a station and other on site infrastructure with good links to existing
services and facilities in the town will ensure that the site is sustainable in the long term as well as
help support the future vitality of such services within Middlewich. This should include the on-site
identification of a new railway station for the town. If an alternative location for the railway station
beyond the site is subsequently preferred, following detailed masterplanning work, then the

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

development should contribute to its provision. The British Salt Lagoons located to directly to the
south of the site offer an opportunity to explore the potential of enlarging the site in future and making
best use of brownfield land here. The design of the development should respect and capitalise on its
canal-side setting.
15.504 The site relates well to the achievement of the Local Plan Strategy Vision and Objectives
by enhancing environmental quality, promoting conditions for business growth through regeneration
and creating sustainable communities, whilst delivering significant regeneration benefits.
15.505 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.

1.

2.
3.

Phased delivery of up to 70 hectares of employment land, including the development of the
existing undeveloped sites: Midpoint 18 (Phases 1 to 3), with provision expected to continue
for the remaining site beyond the plan period; and
Provision of and where appropriate, contributions to the completion of the Middlewich
Eastern Bypass.
Provision of land set aside to enable the future construction of a new station – in terms of
lineside infrastructure, parking and access.

f.

Maximising connectivity to new and existing areas of Middlewich.
Contributions towards public transport and highways improvements.
Contributions to education and heath infrastructure.
Provision of floorspace to accommodate B1, B2 and B8 uses.
Future development should safeguard the River Croco and other watercourses and deliver
significant ecological mitigation areas for protected and priority species and habitats on
site.
A pre-determination desk based archaeological assessment will be required, with targeted
evaluation as appropriate.

Justification
15.507 The future prosperity of Middlewich largely relies on its proximity to the M6 corridor and the
ability to maximise the opportunities for new and more skilled jobs across a range of employment
types. Strong access to the motorway network gives this site the potential to serve Cheshire,
Merseyside, Greater Manchester and the Potteries within a one hour drive time.
15.508 Midpoint 18 is a large strategic employment site with a total area of some 221.7 hectares.
It comprises an area of existing employment development of 100.7 hectares and an undeveloped
area of 121 hectares. It is expected that up to 70 hectares of the undeveloped area will come forward
within the plan period with the remainder in reserve to be released for employment purposes when
required. A masterplan led approach will be required for the development of this site. Provision of
well planned cycle, pedestrian and road links within and through the site will enhance the sustainability
of the site and its connections to the main urban area and population within Middlewich. Provision of
new public transport services to this location will further enhance the sustainability of the site.
15.509 The site delivers a significant contribution to the Local Plan Strategy Objectives and Vision
by promoting economic prosperity, contributing toward the creation of sustainable communities through
the provision of a better employment / housing balance. The provision of land for a station and other
on site infrastructure with good links to existing services and facilities in the town will ensure that the
site is sustainable in the long term as well as help support the future vitality of such services within
Middlewich. This should include the on-site identification of a new railway station for the town. If an

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

alternative location for the railway station beyond the site is subsequently preferred, following detailed
masterplanning work, then the development should contribute to its provision.

Further information about each of the identified Local Plan Strategy Sites is as follows.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Site LPS 46: Kingsley Fields, Nantwich
15.516 Kingsley Fields is located to the north west of Nantwich. The site offers the opportunity for
a high quality residential scheme and ancillary employment uses which integrates with the town centre
to the south, as well as providing green spaces linking green infrastructure and safe and secure
pedestrian/cycle routes to the northern edge of Nantwich and gives the opportunity to extend the
Nantwich Riverside Park.
15.517 The site is bounded by the A51 to the north, the River Weaver to the east, playing fields
and Nantwich Town Football Club stadium (Weaver Stadium) to the south and Welshman's Lane to
the west. The site is predominantly greenfield and covers an area of around 58 hectares.

should be treated as a wetland landscape buffer zone, with public access, including
formal footpaths and cycle ways;
Allotments;
Open space provision, including sports pitches; multi-use games area; children's
equipped play space; outdoor gym and facilities for teenagers;
Land to remain undeveloped to the west of the River Weaver, as shown on Figures
15.54 and 15.55, to include public access to the immediate riverside.

Site Specific Principles of Development
a.
b.

Incorporation of existing mature trees and hedgerows in potential development.
Improvements to existing and the provision of new pedestrian and cycle links to new and
existing residential areas, employment areas, shops, education and health facilities. This
may involve the need to provide new crossing points over the River Weaver. Cycle routes
should ensure that the site and Reaseheath College are connected to the Connect 2
Greenway route (this may be partly achieved by contributions).

The provision of contributions towards the highway improvements, including at Burford
Cross Roads, the realignment of the A51 and link between A51 and Waterlode and
contribution to improvements to Alvaston Roundabout.
The provision of contributions towards public transport improvements.
The provision of contributions to health infrastructure.
A desk based archaeological assessment, with further work and mitigation being carried
out as required as the overall archaeological potential of the site is considered to be high.
Every opportunity should be made to increase the understanding and appreciation of the
(90)
significance of the scheduled battlefield and its setting
and the site's archaeological
potential. This should be reflected in the masterplanning and design of the site, including
in terms of roads, views, landscaping and open spaces. The design must also seek to
minimise and mitigate any adverse impact on the Reaseheath Conservation Area.
The creation of green spaces linking green infrastructure and safe and secure pedestrian
and cycle routes should be integrated into any development proposals.
Retention of the floodplain of the River Weaver; a large area of the site lies within the
floodplain of the River Weaver which needs to be protected from development.
The extension of the Nantwich Riverside Park and the creation of a Riverside Walk, from
the southern edge of the site, to Beam Bridge, to link with the countryside beyond.
The preservation of views towards local landmarks e.g. St Mary's Church Tower and Acton
Church Tower.
The development should provide compensatory habitat for great crested newts and other
protected and priority species and habitats on the site.
The Local Plan Strategy site is expected to provide affordable housing in line with the policy
requirements set out in Policy SC 5 'Affordable Homes'.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the site.
A site specific Flood Risk Assessment would be required to demonstrate that the proposed
development would be safe from fluvial flooding and would not increase the risk of flooding
elsewhere.
Ensure that the masterplanning and design of the site incorporates the retention and
integration of the most important buildings within the non-designated heritage asset of
Henhull Hall Farm.

The setting of the scheduled battlefield being the surroundings within which the asset is experienced. This isn’t
constrained to the visual relationship with the asset but could also be how a piece of land or area contributes toward
historical understanding of the events that influenced the battle and its location.

15.518 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents and
those working within the town, as well as enhancing the environment of the town.
15.519 Nantwich Riverside lies adjacent to the eastern boundary of the site and is a key green /
blue infrastructure asset to the town. Appropriate landscaping and open space will be provided and
this will be integrated with development proposals throughout the site.
15.520 The site will provide an extension to the Nantwich Riverside Park which is an important
recreational asset to the town. The site includes an area of floodplain which will be incorporated within
the Nantwich Riverside Park. The Cheshire East Greenspace Strategy includes further reference to
the Nantwich Riverside Park.
15.521 The Connect 2 Greenway route will also be linked to this site, providing a sustainable link
to other parts of Nantwich and to Crewe.
15.522 Immediately to the west of the site lies the site of the Nantwich Civil War battlefield, included
on English Heritage's Register of Battlefields. The northern part of the allocated site includes part of
Reaseheath Conservation Area. These heritage assets will be protected and enhanced through an
appropriate landscaping, design and heritage assessment. The part of the allocated site within
Reaseheath Conservation Area is not significantly affected by the current application. Any development
proposals within the conservation area must be of a very high standard, reflecting their location.
15.523 The site has high archaeological potential which will be explored further, through assessment
and mitigation work, as required.
15.524 The site will enhance accessibility to key facilities; the town centre and the Connect 2
Greenway for pedestrians and cyclists.

Site LPS 47: Snow Hill, Nantwich
15.532 Snow Hill comprising of municipal car parks, town centre retail, public leisure facilities and
open space presents the opportunity for a high quality development in a sustainable location. The
site is suitable for a range of uses including retail and leisure development. Snow Hill will create a
mixed use quarter which complements the vibrancy and character of Nantwich town centre by linking
the River Weaver into the heart of the historic market town. Snow Hill will be a distinctive and
sustainable place that contributes to the rich tapestry of buildings, streets and spaces in Nantwich
and provides an attractive destination to raise the profile of the historic town of Nantwich within the
region.
15.533 Snow Hill occupies 8.5 hectares, located to the western edge of Nantwich town centre and
acts as a key gateway into the town. The site is adjacent to town centre facilities and has good
pedestrian linkages.
15.534 A main arterial route for the town (Waterlode B5341) cuts north-south through the site with
the River Weaver bisecting the site in the same direction also linking into the Nantwich Riverside
Loop and the Weaver Valley.

Site LPS 47
Snow Hill, Nantwich
The development of Snow Hill over the Local Plan Strategy period will be achieved through:
The comprehensive mixed use regeneration of this important site to strengthen and enhance
the existing town centre and take advantage of its location next to the River Weaver. The
site is suitable for a number of uses including:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.
vii.
2.

Retail, including opportunities for small, independent retailers;
Leisure and sports facilities;
Offices;
Hotel including a conference venue;
Parking;
Housing; and
Bars and cafés.

The provision of high quality design is of paramount importance, as this site includes
numerous listed buildings, a listed structure and lies partly within the Nantwich Conservation
Area. Development should have regard to the need to conserve and enhance and have a
positive impact upon the character and appearance of the listed buildings and conservation
area, including their settings. Development should also have regard to the proposals of the
Nantwich Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (17/12/12), including the
impact of proposals on Local List candidates that lie within or adjacent to this site.

Site Specific Principles of Development
a.

b.

A design framework including a masterplan which ensures that the site is seen as being
part of the town centre, by the creation of strong links between Snow Hill and the existing
town centre; the establishment of active new frontages; high quality urban design; clear
and easy to use pedestrian and cycle routes, both throughout the site and between the site
and the town centre and to facilitate a radical improvement to the environmental quality of
Swinemarket.
Retail provision to include small units, to ensure opportunities are given to independent
retailers as well as adding to and complementing the existing retailing and leisure offer of
the town.

substantial native woodland tree planting and a wetland landscape buffer zone, with
public access, including formal footpaths and cycleways to improve levels of access
to the River Weaver and its banks;
Open space provision.

Create a series of interconnected, attractive streets and spaces.
The design of new buildings to be of a very high standard, reflecting the site's location within
and adjacent to the Nantwich Conservation Area.
This area is within an area of archaeological potential and an area of special archaeological
potential which included nationally-important waterlogged archaeological deposits. A desk
based archaeological assessment and a pre-determination evaluation will be required, with
further work and mitigation being carried out as appropriate to preserve the archaeological
value of Snow Hill.
On site provision, or where appropriate, relevant contributions towards highways and
transport, education, health, green infrastructure, open space and community facilities.
Improvement to Waterlode / Welsh Row junction.
Deliver a distinctive destination for local people to be proud of and visitors to enjoy.
Proposals should consider impacts of development on the listed 'Nantwich Bridge' and its
setting.
Proposals should include an assessment of the contribution the area makes to the
conservation area, including views of the conservation area.
A minimum of a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment for contaminated land should be
carried out to demonstrate that the site is, or could be made, suitable for use should it be
found to be contaminated. Further work, including a site investigation, may be required at
a pre-planning stage, depending on the nature of the part of the site concerned.
New development will be expected to respect any flooding constraints on the site and where
necessary provide appropriate mitigation.
Retention of the floodplain of the River Weaver; a large area of the site lies within the
floodplain of the River Weaver which needs to be protected from development.
Development proposals will be required to demonstrate that they will conserve and enhance
the character and appearance of the listed buildings, listed structure and conservation area,
including their settings and also show how regard has been paid to the impact of development
proposals on the heritage of the town.
Development on the site should provide compensatory habitat for any protected and priority
species and habitats on the site.

15.537 The site includes an area of archaeological potential; an area of special archaeological
potential which includes nationally important waterlogged archaeological deposits, listed buildings
and lies within and adjacent to the Nantwich Conservation Area. The best practice contained in the
‘Nantwich Waterlogged Deposits Report No 3 Management Strategy: Supplementary Planning
Document for the Historic Environment and Archaeological Deposits: Area of Special Archaeological
Potential (Revised June 2016)’ will need to be applied with regard to development proposals on the
site. These heritage assets will be protected and enhanced through appropriate design, heritage
assessment and landscaping. The southern extent of the site lies within the Nantwich Conservation
Area, an area of archaeological potential as well as having several listed buildings (including Nantwich
Bridge that crosses over the river) within and around the periphery of the site. Development within
the site will need to have regard to the proposals of the Nantwich Conservation Area Appraisal and
Management Strategy (17/12/12). This may include the opportunity to enhance the open grassed
areas and car parks alongside the River Weaver, within and adjacent to the Nantwich Conservation
Area. A number of local list candidates (Manor House, No. 7, 7a and 7b Beam Street, The Old Biot
(brine spring site), Snow Hill The Watermill site, Waterlode) are located within or adjacent to the site
and are important features of the character and appearance of the conservation area; the impact of
development proposals on these local list candidates must therefore be taken into consideration with
regard to development proposals for the site.

15.535 The River Weaver is a key site in Cheshire for both water vole and otter. It is important
therefore that the river corridor is enhanced and safeguarded as part of any development.
15.536 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents and
those working within the town, as well as enhancing the environment of the town. Nantwich Riverside
runs through the site and is a key green / blue infrastructure asset to the town. An extension to the
Nantwich Riverside Walk, on both sides of the River Weaver, will be provided as part of this
development.

15.538 The Nantwich swimming baths is an important asset to the town and includes an outdoor
brine swimming pool. It is important therefore that this is retained and incorporated within the
development scheme for the site.
15.539 Part of the site is located within an area of flood risk / flood plain of the River Weaver and
as such will need to be protected from development and included as part of the extended Riverside
Park.
15.540 Part of this site is in an area of former gasworks and therefore has potential contamination
issues which should be considered in any future application. The remaining area of the site is also
potentially contaminated and should therefore also be subject to appropriate studies and remediation.
15.541 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.542 Protected and priority species and their habitats are present on the site. It is therefore
important that development on the site provides appropriate mitigation.
Indicative Site Delivery
The St Annes Lane area of the site is expected to be delivered during the early part of the plan
period (2016-2020), with the remaining area of the site being delivered during the middle and
latter parts of the plan period (2020-2030)

15.552 It is important that cycle and pedestrian links between the site and the surrounding residential
areas and countryside are provided to improve connectivity within and around the town.
15.553 Impacts on education and health infrastructure will require appropriate mitigation. Provision
of access improvements for Lower Park School can be considered as part of the overall mitigation
measures.
15.554 The development of this site would assist in the delivery of additional car parking for Poynton

15.560 Part of the site is affected by flood risk (Poynton Brook), and a sequential test has been
applied in line with national planning policy. Policy PG 6 'Spatial Distribution of Development' identifies
that an additional 650 dwellings should be provided at Poynton. In the absence of alternative,
reasonably available sites within or immediately adjacent to Poynton for housing development with
a lower probability of flooding, the allocation of Land Adjacent to Hazelbadge Road satisfies the
Sequential Test. Through a site specific Flood Risk Assessment, carried out to inform any planning
application proposal, it should be demonstrated that the proposed development would be safe from
fluvial flooding, and would not increase the risk of flooding elsewhere. As with any development
adjacent to a main river an undeveloped buffer zone should be provided. The buffer zone needs to
be 8 metres wide measured from bank top for the whole extent of the watercourse. Bank top is defined
as the point at which the bank meets normal land levels.
15.561 An archaeological assessment will be required, to ensure that there will not be an impact
on heritage assets.
15.562 Any new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up to date and robust

15.581 The site is located on the edge of Poynton, to the north west of the town. The site has been
identified to deliver some 150 dwellings and presents an opportunity to deliver a high quality,
sustainable residential development, whilst supporting the delivery of key infrastructure through
financial contributions towards the delivery of the Poynton Relief Road. The eastern and northern
boundaries of the site are formed by existing residential developments.
15.582 The site is mainly greenfield and covers an area of about 4 hectares. There is good access
to the site by road from the town and it is close to Poynton Railway Station.
15.583 It is important that cycle and pedestrian links between the site and the surrounding residential
areas and countryside are provided to improve connectivity within and around the town. In particular,
links to the housing area / primary school to the east.
15.584 The provision of green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and well-being of residents and
employees, as well as enhancing the environment of the local area.
15.585 The council would require the retention of existing trees and hedges. Full consideration of
mitigation and management should be given to the impact on the footpath running through the site.
Boundary treatments should be reinforced so as to ensure a strong long term perimeter to the Green
Belt.
15.586 Habitats for protected species and appropriate mitigation, if required, will be provided within
the site; the development will have to be appropriately sited to make sure that there is not any adverse
impact on such habitat areas.

15.588 The site has potential for contamination to be present, therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.
15.589 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green infrastructure
and open space proposals should be submitted to the council during any future planning application
process on this site as part of sustainable development proposals.
15.590 The Poynton Relief Road is a proposed 1.9 mile highway running between the A6 Manchester
Airport Relief Road (A6MARR) and A523 London Road, which will relieve congestion in and around
Poynton, improve links to Macclesfield and support economic, physical and social regeneration of
the area.

Figure 15.61 Adlington Business Park Extension Site

15.593 This plan provides for 380 hectares of employment during the plan period up to 2030. This
site will make a positive contribution to help meet this overall employment land requirement and
provide opportunities for employment growth in the town. The site will also help to address the ratio
of workplace-based employment to residence-based employment for Poynton identified in the Spatial
(91)
Distribution Update Report .
15.594 The site is located on the edge of the built form of Poynton to the south west of the
settlement. The site has been identified to deliver around 10ha of employment land and presents an
opportunity to deliver a high quality, sustainable employment development, whilst supporting the
delivery of key infrastructure through financial contributions towards the delivery of the Poynton Relief
Road. The site is adjacent to Adlington Business Park; an existing employment site.
15.595 The preferred route of the Poynton Relief Road will form the western boundary of the site.
If the planned Poynton Relief Road is not built, or the current identified route is altered significantly,
then a further Green Belt assessment of this site would be required.
15.596 The new Green Belt boundary should be defined using physical features that are readily
recognisable and are likely to be permanent, for example (but not restricted to) continuous physical
features such as significant hedges, stone walls, and line of trees.
15.597 A full planning application (15/4865M) has been submitted on the eastern parcel of the site
for the erection of a logistics warehouse (6,728sqm) and ancillary trade sales. A decision is awaited.
15.598 It is important that the proximity of the residential dwellings is taken into consideration in
any development proposals, with the provision of appropriate mitigation where necessary.

15.599 The incorporation of green infrastructure, notably trees, hedgerows, and greenways, together
with sensitive design in terms of the scale and massing of any new structures, has the potential to
mitigate any adverse impacts on visual amenity from main public vantage points. This will also assist
in enhancing the environment of the local area, and improving the health and wellbeing of employees.
15.600 It is important that cycle and pedestrian links between the site and the surrounding residential
areas are provided to improve connectivity within and around the town. The council would seek
opportunities to provide for future pedestrian and cycle links up to the adjacent safeguarded land
(LPS 52) and to enable a comprehensive route to be eventually established for cyclists and pedestrians
linking the allocated site to the railway station.
15.601 The provision of a pedestrian crossing across the A523 London Road, linking to footpath
Adlington FP53, along with the improvement of this footpath, would provide enhanced pedestrian
access to the site. Improving pedestrian access to the railway station can also be achieved through
the reinstatement of footpaths, linking to existing footpaths, through the former Woodford Aerodrome
site.
15.602

The council would require the retention of existing trees and hedges on the site.

15.603 Full consideration should be given to the impact of development on the footpath crossing
the site, with appropriate mitigation and management measures introduced as required.
15.604 Habitat for protected species and appropriate mitigation, if required, will be provided within
the site; the development will have to be appropriately sited to make sure that there is not any adverse
impact on such habitat areas.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

15.605 The eastern parcel of the site lies to the north of a group of cottages and listed buildings in
an historic area know as Hopegreen. An archaeological assessment and a Heritage Impact Assessment
will be required to make sure that there will not be an impact on heritage assets.

352

15.606 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’. This is likely to be addressed as part of the Poynton Relief Road
construction.
15.607 The site has potential for contamination to be present, therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.
15.608 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green infrastructure

process on this site as part of sustainable development proposals.
15.609 The Poynton Relief Road is a proposed 1.9 mile highway running between the A6 Manchester
Airport Relief Road (A6MARR) and A523 London Road, which will relieve congestion in and around
Poynton, improve links to Macclesfield and support economic, physical and social regeneration of
the area.
15.610 If the planned Poynton Relief Road is not built, or the current identified route is altered
significantly, then a further Green Belt assessment of this site would be required.

opportunity to deliver a mixed used development site with the primary use of the site being for
employment purposes, whilst acknowledging that supporting residential development will be needed
to help enable the access and infrastructure improvements required to deliver the whole site. It is
intended that the development of the site will include the provision of supporting facilities,
complimentary to the principal employment use whilst also protecting important existing environmental
features.

Figure 15.64 Land adjacent to Junction 17 of M6, south east of Congleton Road Site

15.620 The strategic site is well connected to the existing settlement of Sandbach and contained
by existing residential development to the north, west and south. To the east, the site boundary is
formed by the M6 motorway. Capricorn lies at the gateway to Sandbach offering an excellent
opportunity to capitalise on strong links to the M6, attract investment and skills to locate in the town
and deliver a high quality sustainable urban extension.
15.621 The intention of this allocation is to ensure that the primary use of the site is for employment
purposes with around 20 hectares being required for this purpose. Sandbach is experiencing substantial
housing growth and this employment opportunity is key to ensuring that a balance of housing and
employment development can come forward over the plan period. The employment component of
the allocation is therefore seen as central to the achievement of sustainable development for the
town. The site is allocated for class B1 business and B2 industrial, taking account of the characteristics
of the site and the need for greater employment in Sandbach. However residential development up
to 450 dwellings may be required as a sub-ordinate use to cover the infrastructure costs needed to
enable delivery of the whole site. This will improve accessibility and provide contributions to
improvements to the surrounding highway network including future improvements to junction 17 of
the M6 motorway and the junctions on the A534 Old Mill Road corridor.
15.622 A key infrastructure consideration is the provision of a new access road and bridge across
the wildlife corridor. This will provide a link between the principal site access by junction 17 and the
main area of employment land in the centre of the site. The employment area should be separated
from adjoining areas of housing by a landscaped tree buffer. Development of areas adjoining the
Wildlife corridor should be accompanied by proposals for its retention and enhancement. This includes
the provision of a management plan to govern long term management arrangements. In order to
ensure that the bridge across the wildlife corridor is delivered, the council will consider using its
compulsory purchase powers to enable the delivery of this key element of infrastructure.

15.623 The site should be developed in accordance with the allocations set out in Figure 15.64;
this provides the appropriate balance of uses to meet the housing and employment needs of the
town.
15.624 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents and
those working within the town, as well as enhancing the environment of the town. Appropriate
landscaping and open space will be provided and integrated with adjacent development.
15.625 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up

Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that employment land allocations in mixed use schemes will be phased in tandem
with the housing allocations. Where appropriate, the phased release of employment land will be
secured through S106 agreements/obligations.

15.629 The Royal London site presents an opportunity to deliver a high quality, sustainable, mixed
use development to contribute to the identified housing needs of the town of Wilmslow, as well as
contributing to the provision of the borough’s knowledge-based industry and open space provision.
15.630 This site is located to the south west of Wilmslow town centre and is split into two parts
across Alderley Road. The east section of the site is bordered by the West Coast Main Line and A34
Wilmslow Bypass to the east and south of the site, with residential development and playing fields
to the north. The section west of Alderley Road is currently agricultural land bounded by housing to
the north, west, and south; and by the existing Royal London Campus (across Alderley Road) to the
east.
15.631 The site includes the existing Royal London campus, which is to be retained. With the
exception of one or two hedgerows, the non-developed area of the site is open in nature, with numerous
trees dotted along the site boundary, and a small area of wooded cover to the south west of the site.
There are also ponds and a brook within the site that has resulted in a small area of the far southern
end of the site being in flood zone 3.

d.

A new public realm between existing and proposed employment uses, which will assist
with the integration and provide an attractive setting for new development;
Land for additional playing fields accessible from Wilmslow High School; and
A new public open space at the southern end of land west of Alderley Road.

361

Justification
15.633 This site presents an ideal opportunity for an infill development which, with a mixed use
scheme, will facilitate the growth and expansion of a major employment site, provide jobs and meet
Wilmslow's much needed requirements for open space provision, whilst retaining the character of
the area.
15.634 The Royal London site currently performs an essential role in providing employment in a
key growth sector and this site is vital in providing future employment opportunities in Wilmslow. The
council has received a planning application submitted by Royal London (reference 16/2314M) for a
major new office building on the land to the east of the current campus. This could result in existing
buildings within the existing campus becoming available for reoccupation or redevelopment, providing
scope for extension of the mixed use approach across this part of the allocation. Development of the
land east of the existing campus site should be phased so that employment uses can be brought
forward alongside the residential development. Housing will therefore act as an ‘enabler’ to ensure
that employment development takes place.
15.635 A cohesive approach must be taken when considering the layout of the site, good connectivity
between existing and new developments and open space provision will be essential in ensuring a
well designed and sustainable site. A new public realm between existing and proposed employment
uses will be required.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations

15.636 High quality design will also be very important. New development will be expected to
preserve or enhance the setting of designated heritage assets located within the site, as well as the
character of the surrounding area including the visual character of the entrance into Wilmslow from
the south along Alderley Road. Proposals on the land west of Alderley Road should also have regard
to the adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance Note (2004) 'Development in Established Residential
Areas: Fulshaw Park’.

362

15.637 New residential development should be situated to the north of the site to protect the
amenities of residential properties with the existing and proposed employment uses.
15.638 By virtue of its location and leafy character it is considered that this site offers an ideal
setting for a hotel along Alderley Road frontage. The hotel will not only generate additional employment
opportunities but will offer a supporting facility for businesses.
15.639 A full comprehensive landscaping scheme will be fundamental in ensuring the proposed
development is in keeping with the character of the area and should secure a sensitive green buffer
between proposed residential and employment zones.
15.640 There is significant tree coverage, particularly to the west of this site, therefore existing
mature trees and hedging will be expected to be maintained where possible, or replaced with mitigation.
15.641 New development will also be expected to respect any existing ecological constraints on
site and, where necessary, provide appropriate mitigation.
15.642 The eastern section of this site is already served by two existing access points off Alderley
Road. In order to accommodate the new development existing access points will need to be enhanced,
where appropriate, and/or seek to introduce a new access point. A new access point off Alderley
Road will be required for the western section. Individual dwellings should not have their own direct
accesses to Alderley Road.
15.643 Integration within the surrounding community, town centre and railway station will be
important in ensuring the sustainability of this development, therefore contributions to enhancements
or the provision of new linkages will be encouraged.
15.644
The council's Green Space Strategy has identified that there is a specific need for open
space within South West Wilmslow. The inclusion of a new area of public open space as part of the
residential development of land west of Alderley Road will provide a facility for existing and future

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

residents, which will protect an area of the land from development and retain a feature that offers a
high contribution to the character of this particular area.
15.645 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.646 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that employment land allocations in mixed use schemes will be phased in tandem
with the housing allocations. Where appropriate, the phased release of employment land will be
secured through S106 agreements/obligations.

15.647
The Wilmslow Business Park site presents an opportunity to deliver a high quality,
sustainable, employment led development to contribute to the growth of the borough’s
knowledge-based industry.
15.648 The site is located to the south east of the town centre of Wilmslow, is bordered on the west
side by the West Coast Main Line, and to the east by the A34 Wilmslow bypass.
15.649 The site is relatively flat with a small stream running through it; a belt of mature trees run
along the western boundary of the site adjacent to the West Coast Main line, with further trees and
shrubs running along the A34 boundary.
15.650

Allocation of this site involved an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.

Site LPS 55
Wilmslow Business Park
The development of the Wilmslow Business Park site over the Local Plan Strategy period will
be achieved through:

Figure 15.67 Wilmslow Business Park Site

15.651 Located within close proximity of Wilmslow town centre and transportation links this former
Green Belt site offers an ideal opportunity for development. Bounded by the A34 and West Coast
Mainline this site is surrounded by defensible boundaries and is therefore an opportune environment
for a sustainable employment site.
15.652 Development of the site would contribute to Wilmslow’s expanding knowledge based
industry, facilitate jobs and contribute to both the town and wider borough objectives towards economic
growth. It provides excellent linkages and visibility from the main A34 road. The mainline railway
station lies less than half a mile to the north.
15.653 The isolated nature of this site restricted by its boundaries, narrow shape and limited access
point will, as with all developments, require a high level of design but will also allow scope for an
innovative design solution, which will overcome constraints. A future master plan for this development
would therefore be desired.
15.654 To ensure the principles of sustainable development are achieved, enhancements to the
existing access will be essential to provide linkage of this development with the town centre and wider
community.
15.655 A comprehensive landscaping scheme will be fundamental to providing an attractive setting
for the business park as well as providing a landscape buffer between the railway line, A34 Bypass
and the education use to the north.
15.656 Open space provision offers an important contribution to the health and wellbeing of the
local community. The playing fields north of the site will therefore need to be either retained within
the site or provision made off site.

15.657 Development will be required to take existing ecological constraints on site into consideration,
such as a brook which runs through the site. Existing mature trees and hedging will be expected to

Justification
15.664 The site offers an excellent opportunity for a sustainable residential development which will
contribute to meeting Wilmslow’s housing requirements.
15.665 The site is reasonably well located to Wilmslow with bus routes nearby and within easy
walking distance to Handforth Railway Station and district centre, provided an appropriate pedestrian
linkage to Manchester Road is provided. This needs to be a direct safe and level access in order that
the full sustainable potential of the site can be realised.
15.666
With a quality design, the development of the site could respect the character and
distinctiveness of the locality with quality design. Green links along the River Dean could be created,

Figure 15.72 Wardle Employment Improvement Area Site

Justification
15.691 A former Royal Air Force airfield, industrial and commercial development has grown on the
site over the past few decades since the closure of the airfield. At present the site is a mix of existing
businesses and open countryside. Existing employment development is focused around the Wardle
Industrial Estate (along Green Lane) and the North West Farmers complex (Boughey’s distribution)
accessed directly from the A51. The built form of the area comprises a variety of large units in use
for industrial and storage/distribution purposes.
15.692 The suitability of Wardle as a focus for employment uses is well established. The history
of the site and surrounding area has long been one of employment and industrial related activities
including agricultural related uses. Over time the majority of the former airfield buildings have been
reutilised or redeveloped, which has led to several highly successful businesses expanding
incrementally over time such as North West Farmers and those located at Wardle Industrial Estate.
15.693 A comprehensive approach to the future development of this site is required, which focuses
on retaining existing natural features where possible, for example by designing the Masterplan around
the existing hedgerow pattern and by retaining higher quality trees. The Masterplan will ensure that
an appropriate landscape-driven employment park is achieved, in keeping with the character of the
surrounding area.
15.694 This site is now has outline planning approval with a signed Section 106 agreement (ref
13/2035N).

Site LPS 61: Alderley Park Opportunity Site
15.695 Alderley Park is an existing employment site located to the south east of Nether Alderley,
occupied by the worldwide pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, and incorporates the BioHub
(94)
Incubator. Whilst the site provided approximately 2,900 jobs , the majority of which were highly
skilled research and development posts, AstraZeneca announced plans to scale down its facility at
Alderley Park. There is therefore a need to reconsider the future of this strategic employment site.
15.696 As a previously-developed site within the Green Belt, it is not proposed to alter the existing
Green Belt boundary at Alderley Park.

is no overall increase in the developed footprint.

4. Development would not have a greater impact on the openness and visual amenity of the
Green Belt and the purposes of including land within it than existing development.

Figure 15.73 Alderley Park Opportunity Site

Justification
15.697 Although this site is designated as an existing employment site, the National Planning Policy
Framework states that ‘policies should avoid the long term protection of sites allocated for employment
uses where there is no reasonable prospect of a site being used for that purpose’. Following the
announcement by AstraZeneca of their plans to reduce the scale of their facility on this site to around
700 jobs by 2016, Cheshire East Council has sought to work alongside the company to maximise
the potential of this site as a specialist employment facility. The council and AstraZeneca have a
shared aspiration that the site should evolve from a single occupier site to a 'cluster' of life science
businesses with a particular focus on human health science research and development, technologies
and processes.

restricted to those that have been demonstrated as either necessary for the delivery of the desired
life science park and not prejudicial to its longer term growth, or complimentary to the life science
park and not prejudicial to its establishment or growth.
15.699 The Alderley Park Development Framework has been developed to proactively guide any
future development on the site. The site is subject to a planning application (15/5401M, registered
on 30/11/15) for the demolition of a number of specified buildings, and a mixed use development.
15.700

For the avoidance of doubt this site remains within the Green Belt.

15.701 Any replacement and/or new sports provision should be in accordance with an adopted up
to date and robust Playing Pitch Strategy and Indoor Sports Strategy and with Policy SC 2 ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.702 The site has potential for contamination to be present, therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land needs to be carried out to ensure that any contamination
that is present is subject to appropriate remediation.
15.703 A proposal needs to be put forward and agreed with Sport England that replaces the playing
fields to an equivalent or better quantity and quality in a suitable location.
15.704 In line with the development framework, a high quality of design, together with a commitment
to quality of materials, finishes, detailing and landscaping will be required, reflecting the unique
characteristics of the site.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

381

16 Monitoring and Implementation
16.1 This Local Plan Strategy will influence positive changes for the people who live, work and visit
the borough, by addressing the key challenges that face it. It is therefore essential that changes are
measured through a monitoring framework. Monitoring will assess the delivery and effectiveness of
achieving the vision, objectives, spatial strategy, the strategic priorities and the policies. In addition,
one of the key tests of soundness for the Local Plan Strategy is to ensure the plan is “effective” and
that the plan is deliverable in the plan period.
16.2 The Local Authority will produce an Authority Monitoring Report (AMR), which will be published
annually on the council's website for public view. The AMR will demonstrate how the policies within
the Local Plan Strategy are achieving their objectives by:
Assessing the performance of the Local Plan Strategy and other Local Plan documents by
considering progress against the indicators proposed;
Setting out Cheshire East's updated housing trajectory;
Identifying the need to reassess or review any policies or approaches;
Making sure the context and assumptions behind our strategy and policies are still relevant;
Identifying trends in the wider social, economic and environmental issues facing Cheshire East
affecting the Local Plan policies.
16.3 The council has ensured the monitoring framework is Specific, Measurable, Achievable and
Realistic and, where appropriate, Time bound (SMART) in order that the Local Plan Strategy will
meet the National Planning Policy Framework's tests of soundness. Some of the policies will relate
to more than just one indicator, thereby a more comprehensive snapshot may be achieved. One
indicator may have a multiple of uses and therefore refer to more than just one policy.
16.4 Monitoring data will be drawn from a whole range of sources. These sources will include
national, regional and locally published sources, surveys carried out by the council, for example
annual employment, retail and housing completion surveys, and town centre surveys. It will also
include the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) and other surveys carried out
in conjunction with stakeholders and partners as applicable.

Monitoring and Implementation

16.5 The AMR will provide the council with an indication through measured indicators as to whether
the plan is meeting key Strategic Priorities. Where the evidence or trends show there is under
performance or policies are out of date or clearly not providing their aim this would trigger the council
to take action. This trigger will vary depending on the indicator in question. The council will consider
what action is needed, for example whether the policy needs to be strengthened, maintained or revise
that part of the Local Plan Strategy, whichever was the more appropriate.

382

16.6 The Local Plan Strategy is intended to be a robust document, suitable for setting the direction
of development locally for the next 20 years. Nevertheless, changing conditions may be so significant
as to require a review or partial review of the Local Plan Strategy, for example; where development
fails to come forward due to infrastructure or land assembly difficulties, significant changes to national
planning policy or because of influences beyond its control. Where appropriate, the council will work
collaboratively with developers and stakeholders to find solutions or it may be able to use its influence
and powers to assist in the delivery.
16.7 There are a number of contingency measures the council could apply if issues materialise. In
the event of difficulties arising, the steps the council will apply will be dependent on the situation,
each being assessed on its individual merits. Should an issue arise, examples of remedial actions
that the council could consider applying are as follows:
Review and re prioritise head of terms for securing developer contributions to enable priority
schemes to be developed;
Review its SHLAA and Site Allocations and Development Policies Document to bring forward
new sites;

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Carry out an employment land review and Market Appraisal of Employment land to maximise
their efficient use;
Consider the release of sites to achieve a five year housing supply; and
Use its compulsory purchase powers.
16.8 The direct investment in land and buildings and developer contributions towards infrastructure
will be fundamental to ensuring the implementation of the Local Plan Strategy.
16.9 The Local Plan policies will be implemented through a number of mechanisms, including but
not exclusive to:
Development management, through appropriate consideration of planning applications;
Development and preparation of more detailed policies through the Site Allocations and
Development Policies Document, Minerals and Waste Development Plan Document and future
Supplementary Planning Documents;
Working with partner bodies, organisations, funding bodies, businesses and developers through
private and public sector partnership arrangements and investment;
Partnership working with public sector partners such as health and social care providers;
Funding mechanisms including developer contributions and the Community Infrastructure Levy;
Private sector, including registered landlords;
Local Design Review, design and quality audits and awards;
Preparation of town / village design statements and Neighbourhood Plans by town / parish
councils and local communities;
Regular updating of the evidence base to support the Local Plan, as required.

Proposed Employment Land Distribution
A.3 The Tables below illustrate the proposed distribution of employment land across Cheshire East
as distributed across Principal Towns, Key Service Centres, Local Service Centres and Other
Settlements and Rural Areas.
A.4 The figures for take-up between 2010 and 2013 are the gross take-up of new employment land
for employment (B1, B2 and B8) uses. The take-up figures do not include redevelopment of existing
employment sites for employment use or the losses of employment land to other uses.
A.5 The employment land supply is the amount of land available for new employment development.
It includes sites with permission for employment development, sites under construction, existing
employment allocations and new allocations in this Local Plan Strategy. It does not include permissions
for redevelopment for employment uses where the site is already being used for employment. It does

Appendix C: Parking Standards
C.1 The following sets out the parking standards that the council applies to new developments.
Table C.1 ‘Car Parking Standards’ will only apply where there is clear and compelling justification
that it is necessary to manage the road network. Reference should be made to the Cheshire East
Parking Standards - Guidance Note (October 2012) or, if superseded, to the latest parking standards
guidance.
C.2 Cheshire East Council will accept representations to vary from car parking standards on a
site-by-site basis with reference to evidence obtained locally or from a suitable data source (e.g.
TRICS) outlining predicted parking profiles that would allow departures from the Standards set out
below.
C.3 Guidance provided from the National Planning Policy Framework has been used to develop
these parking standards.
C.4 The parking standards that apply for residential dwelling houses are minimum standards and
for all other uses the standards should be regarded as recommended levels. The parking provision
will also take account of:
Availability and cost of parking spaces on site and close by;
How regular and frequent public transport is;
How easy it is to access a site by safe walking and cycling routes;
Operational needs of proposed developments; and
Relationship between different land uses, such as how close housing is to employment, shops
and leisure uses.

Type

Dimensions and Requirements

Size and Layout of
Standard Parking
Bays (including
residential
developments)

Standard parking bays are to be provided at a size of 4.8m x 2.5m. (This increase in width
to cater for the increasing size of cars on the market).
Good circulation around car parks is an important factor in ensuring the safety of pedestrians
moving to and from their vehicles. As such aisle widths should be set at a minimum of
6.9m for two-way routes to allow for ease of movement to/from spaces without unnecessarily
impeding pedestrians and other vehicles. For one-way routes the aisle width can be
reduced to a minimum 6.0m.

Domestic Garage The recommended minimum clear internal dimensions for a domestic single garage are
Dimensions
2.7 metres x 5.5 metres.
Developers should note that dimensions less than this will not necessarily be considered
to qualify against the parking ratios for residential development.
Powered Two
Wheeler

Provision should be made for the specific use of the motorcycle otherwise known as
Powered Two Wheeler vehicle or PTWs, on all developments where there are 20 or more
communal parking spaces.
Minimum requirements are for the provision of one secure motorcycle space for car parks
with up to 50 communal car spaces and 2% provision against car space numbers thereafter.
The location of such facilities is an important factor, therefore the chosen area should be
safe and secure, well lit and somewhere where there is good general surveillance.
The space required for parking of a motorcycle is 3.0m x 1.5m, and multiples thereof,
although it is not necessary or desirable to mark bays out individually.

Disabled Parking

Bays for drivers with disabilities should be 3.7m wide or alternatively should consist of two
standard 2.5m bays with shared spaces of 1.2m in between bays. A 1.2m safety zone
should be provided for boot access and cars with rear hoists. The 1.2m safety/unloading
zone at the rear should not project into the 6.0m/6.9m aisle width for circulating traffic as
this would expose disabled drivers to being reversed into in the safe zone. Parent/infant
parking bays to be provided at the same dimensions without the safety zone at the boot
access.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Appendix E: Housing Trajectory

Figure E.1 Housing Trajectory with a Base Date of 31 March 2016

E.1 The housing trajectory for Cheshire East illustrates the expected delivery rate of new dwellings.
It demonstrates how the proposed housing requirement of 36,000 new dwellings will be achieved,
over the whole plan period.
E.2 The ‘Local Plan’ line in the trajectory represents the annualised average housing requirement
of 1,800 dwellings for Cheshire East from 2010 to 2030, as set out in this document. The vertical bars
show the number of dwellings that have been completed, the anticipated supply and the number of
dwellings that are predicted to be built over the plan period.
E.3 From 01 April, 2010 to 31 March 2016, a total of 5,473 dwellings (net) have been constructed,
including C2 uses, leaving 30,527 dwellings to be delivered over the remainder of the plan period.
E.4

The predicted delivery from specific sites comprises:

E.5 The contribution from these sources of supply total 34,850 dwellings, which reduces the
remainder to be identified to 1,150 dwellings.
E.6 The ‘Allowance for Site Allocations’ bar represents the projected delivery from sites which are
not formally identified at present but will be identified in the Site Allocations and Development Policies
Document. This will allocate a further 3,335 over the plan period. For the purposes of this trajectory
this contribution is spread equally over the plan period post 2020 (to allow for the timescales required
for the preparation and adoption of this document).
E.7 The council has also sought to identify a ‘small sites windfall allowance’, which acknowledges
that as well as those already identified sources of supply, there are likely to be sites (comprising 9
units or less) which have not previously been identified which may be brought forward for development.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Housing Trajectory

Commitments (10,822); and
Proposed Strategic Sites and Strategic Locations (18,555).

445

The council has set this allowance at 125 dwellings per annum (excluding Crewe and Macclesfield
given the provisions of LPS 1 and LPS 12) and commencing from 2019/20. This is based upon
evidence of consistent housing delivery from this scale of sites since 2009/10 as detailed within the
Housing Supply and Delivery Topic Paper (as at 31 March 2016). It has been set to take effect from
2019/20 as the council acknowledges that there are already a number of committed sites of 9 or less
units, and this approach removes any potential for double counting than if we were to commence
from the current year (2016/17). This equates to an additional 1,375 units added to the supply over
the remainder of the plan period.

E.8 Altogether, this brings the predicted supply of housing to 39,560 dwellings, taking in to
consideration those completions (as at 31 March 2016), commitments (as at 31 March 2016),
allocations for Strategic Sites and Strategic Locations, site allocations in the SADPD and a small
sites windfall allowance. This equates to almost 10% plan flexibility, which is comfortably above the
36,000 dwellings required. The contribution from each component of the housing supply is summarised

Five Year Housing Land Supply

446

E.9 The NPPF requires that councils identify a five-year supply of ‘deliverable’ housing land in their
development plans, plus a 5% buffer to allow for choice and competition. Where there has been a
record of persistent under delivery, local planning authorities should increase the buffer to 20% (moved
forward from later in the plan period) to provide a reasonable prospect of achieving the planned supply
and to ensure choice and competition in the market for land. In the context of Cheshire East, set
against an annual target of 1,800 new dwellings per annum and applying a 20% buffer to the
requirement only, would lead to a requirement of 10,800 new homes over the next 5 year period
(2016/17 until 2020/21). However, there is also a shortfall which the council is seeking to address
through the ‘Cheshire East’ methodology (Sedgepool 8), which apportions the previous under delivery
over the first 8 years of the remainder of the plan period. This results in a delivery requirement of
2,466 dwellings per annum as shown on the ‘Cheshire East’ methodology (Sedgepool 8) delivery
requirement line of figure E.1.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

E.10 The sites identified in the Local Plan Strategy have been selected on the basis that they will
make a significant contribution to meeting the housing needs of the area over the whole plan period
and are economically viable in terms of deliverability. Moreover, they will significantly improve the
supply of affordable, intermediate and market housing once the Local Plan Strategy is formally
adopted. There will also be a greater range of sites identified in the Site Allocations and Development
Policies DPD in due course.
E.11 The Local Plan Strategy and its associated trajectory sets out a comprehensive range of sites
(committed or to be allocated) which all have a role in ensuring the council can demonstrate and
maintain a 5 year supply. Each of the sites have been appraised in terms of their delivery potential
over the first five years and remainder of the plan period and in the case of each of the Strategic
Sites, there has been detailed discussions with the relevant landowners / site promoters to ensure
that the timing and yield of development utilised is both robust and justifiable.
E.12 The range of sites outlined in the housing trajectory is considered capable of delivering 15,588
dwellings (including a small sites windfall allowance for years 4 and 5) over the next 5 years. Hence,
using the ‘Cheshire East’ method (Sedgepool 8) and applying a 20% buffer, a 5.3 year supply of
‘deliverable’ housing land is currently available in Cheshire East.

Appendix F: The Local Plan for Cheshire East
What is the Local Plan?
F.1 The Local Plan, when it is fully adopted, will be the complete Development Plan for Cheshire
East (replacing earlier Plans prepared by the former Districts and the County Council) and its policies
will form the basis for planning decisions in the borough. The Local Plan will cover a range of matters
including:
How much employment land is needed and where it should be provided;
Protecting and improving important open areas and providing new ones;
How many new homes will be required and where they should be located;
Providing new transport infrastructure including roads, cycle routes and footpaths; and
How town centres and community facilities in the borough could be improved.
F.2 The Local Plan for Cheshire East will consist of three
key documents. These are:

Adopted Policies
Map

Waste
The Local Plan Strategy, which sets out the vision,
spatial strategy and strategic priorities for the
Site Allocations
development of Cheshire East for the period up to
and
2030. It will be used by everyone who wants to see
Development
how the borough will change and establish what new
Policies
development is expected over the period to 2030.
The document also identifies Local Plan Strategy
Sites and Strategic Locations that will accommodate
Local Plan
Strategy
most of the development intended.
The Local Plan Site Allocations and Development
Policies document, which will allocate the remaining
sites proposed for future development and provide
detailed policies to be used when considering
planning applications for new development across
the borough.
The Minerals and Waste Development Plan
Figure F.1 Content of the Local Plan
Document, which will set out policies for dealing with
minerals and waste and identify specific sites for these purposes.

The Local Plan for Cheshire East

F.3

448

The Local Plan will be supported by an Adopted Policies Map which will:
Define development sites and Green Belt boundaries;
Identify settlement boundaries;
Show where different types of development will be permitted;
Display environmental and heritage designations; and
Show where policies will apply across the area.

F.4

The Local Plan will also be accompanied by an Infrastructure Delivery Plan which will identify:
Future infrastructure needs and costs across the borough;
The phasing and timing of infrastructure provision;
Available funding sources; and
The Infrastructure Providers.

F.5

Other documents that support the Local Plan are:
A Local Development Scheme (LDS), which sets out the programme of the preparation of the
Local Plan documents and Supplementary Planning Documents.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

A Statement of Community Involvement, which sets out how the council will involve the community
and stakeholders in the preparation and review of the Local Plan, Supplementary Planning
Documents and Development Management Decisions.
A Monitoring Report, which assesses progress on the delivery of the Local Plan and its supporting
documents and reviews the effectiveness of the Local Plan.
F.6

Further information on the Local Plan is available at: www.cheshireeast.gov.uk/localplan

Neighbourhood Planning and its relationship to the Local Plan
F.7
Cheshire East Council is committed to engaging local communities in the planning and
development of their areas. Neighbourhood Planning is a way for local communities to shape the
development of the area in which they live. The Localism Act 2011 promoted the concept of
Neighbourhood Planning with the National Planning Policy Framework and Neighbourhood Planning
(General) Regulations 2012 setting out the process, responsibilities and framework for those involved
in the preparation of a Neighbourhood Plan and accompanying processes.
F.8 Crucially, a Neighbourhood Plan must generally conform with the strategic policies contained
in the emerging Cheshire East Local Plan and contribute to the achievement of sustainable
development. Neighbourhood Plans should not repeat the emerging Cheshire East Local Plan or the
National Planning Policy Framework. A Neighbourhood Plan should be complementary and work
alongside the Local Plan and will be expected to follow the overall scale, distribution and location of
development outlined in it.
F.9
Further information on Neighbourhood Planning in Cheshire East can be viewed at:
www.cheshireeast.gov.uk/neighbourhoodplanning

What is the Local Plan Strategy?
F.10 The Local Plan Strategy is the centrepiece of the Cheshire East Local Plan. It sets out the
strategic priorities for the future development of the area together with a suite of planning policies
and proposals designed to deliver sustainable development.
The Local Plan Strategy has been informed by:
The involvement of key stakeholders and local communities, including consultation on:
Core Strategy Issues and Options Paper (Autumn 2010)
Place Shaping Consultation (Summer 2011)
Rural Issues Summary Document (Autumn 2011)
Minerals Issues Discussion Paper (Spring 2012)
Town Strategies Consultation (Spring and Summer 2012)

F.12 The Local Plan Strategy follows a consideration of a range of growth options and an assessment
of all reasonable policy and site alternatives. It includes a number of Local Plan Strategy Sites and
Strategic Locations. It also sets out a number of strategic policies that will be used to deliver sustainable
development in the borough. The Local Plan Strategy is accompanied by an Infrastructure Delivery
Plan which details what supporting infrastructure is required to deliver the Local Plan Strategy Sites
and Strategic Locations in the borough.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Strategic policies contained within the Local Plan Strategy constitute the council's
contribution towards the achievement of sustainable development in Cheshire East and
are designed to be read together as a whole and applied as appropriate.

F.13 The Local Plan Strategy replaces a number of ‘saved’ policies from the Congleton Local Plan,
the Crewe and Nantwich Local Plan, the Macclesfield Local Plan, the Cheshire Minerals Local Plan
and the Cheshire Waste Local Plan. Appendix B sets out which policies are replaced and which
policies continue to be retained.
F.14 The Proposals Maps attached to the Congleton Local Plan, the Crewe and Nantwich Local
Plan, the Macclesfield Local Plan, the Cheshire Minerals Local Plan and the Cheshire Waste Local
Plan are 'saved' for the purposes of determining planning applications.

Appendix G: Evolution of the Local Plan Strategy

Evolution of the Local Plan Strategy

G.1 There have been a number of stages in the development of the Local Plan Strategy. The
consultation stages and associated evidence base collected to support the Local Plan Strategy has
allowed the council to develop a greater understanding of the issues and opportunities that exist
within Cheshire East. Responses received during each previous consultation stage have been
considered and changes made to the overall approach to the Local Plan Strategy as and when
considered appropriate. The key stages in the development of the Local Plan Strategy are set out
in Figure G.1 below:

452

Figure G.1 Key Stages in the Development of the Local Plan Strategy

Core Strategy Issues and Options Paper (November / December 2010)
G.2 The Issues and Options Paper set out options for the overall strategy for the future of the
borough and asked some fundamental questions about what Cheshire East should look like in 2030,
how much growth should be included in the Local Plan Strategy and where, in a broad sense, the
development should be located. The document set out a vision for the future of the borough and
included a number of strategic priorities for consultation.
G.3 The Core Strategy Issues and Options Paper also identified a number of strategic level issues
and options for the future development of the borough. The consultation on the Issues and Options

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

paper highlighted the need to provide a 'bottom up' understanding for the Principal Towns and Key
Service Centres identified in the Determining the Settlement Hierarchy paper.
Place Shaping Consultation (Summer / Autumn 2011)
G.4 To better understand the issues in each of the settlements identified in the Determining the
Settlement Hierarchy paper, a Snapshot Report was prepared for each Principal Town and Key
Service Centre. The Snapshot Report provided information on housing, economy, town centre,
transport, built and natural environment and community infrastructure in each town. The Snapshot
Report and consultation provided a useful insight into the prominent planning issues in the Principal
Towns and Key Service Centres and promoted an overall understanding of Cheshire East as a unified
'place'.
Rural Issues Consultation (October / November 2011)
G.5 A discussion paper on rural issues was prepared which set out the planning context, identified
emerging government guidance and key challenges for the Local Plan Strategy to address. It included
topics on the Rural Economy, Green Belt, Landscape Character, Biodiversity, Heritage, Renewable
Energy, Rural Housing, Transport and Community Facilities. The consultation provided a greater
understanding of planning issues in the rural areas of the borough.
Minerals Issues Consultation (March 2012)
G.6 The Minerals Issues Discussion Paper served to discuss the importance of mineral extraction
in the borough. It gave an opportunity for those parties involved in minerals planning in Cheshire East
to offer their views on how the Local Plan should approach key strategic minerals planning issues.
There was also an opportunity to provide additional information on possible sites and areas of future
mineral working and safeguarding.
Town Strategies (March 2012 - October 2012)

G.8 The Town Strategies set out a vision for each town together with potential development
opportunities and priorities for investment in infrastructure. They also covered other issues such as
the future of each town centre.
G.9 The draft Town Strategies for Alsager, Congleton, Middlewich and Sandbach were prepared
first, as part of a Neighbourhood Planning 'Frontrunner' project, with funding from the Department for
(109)
Communities and Local Government. The strategies for Alsager, Middlewich, Congleton, Sandbach
and Wilmslow have been finalised following consultation and approval by their respective Town
Councils. A similar tailored approach was then used in the preparation of each of the other Town
Strategy documents. The draft Town Strategies for the remaining towns of Crewe, Macclesfield,
Handforth, Knutsford, Nantwich and Poynton have been subject to consultation with local communities.
G.10 The Town Strategies for Alsager, Congleton, Middlewich, Sandbach and Wilmslow and the
draft Town Strategies in Crewe, Macclesfield, Handforth, Knutsford, Nantwich and Poynton now form
part of the evidence base for the Core Strategy.
Development Strategy and Policy Principles (January / February 2013)
G.11 The Development Strategy and Policy Principles consultation presented the council's preferred

next 17 years and proposed levels of development for each of our Principal Towns and Key Service
Centres. It also set out the overall level of proposed development within Local Service Centres, other
settlements and rural villages of the borough with alternative options.
Possible Additional Sites Proposed by Developer and Land Interests Consultation (May 2013)
G.12 Responses received to the Development Strategy revealed a number of other possible
strategic sites that developer, landowners and others considered suitable for inclusion in the Local
Plan Strategy. To ensure everyone had the opportunity to comment on these possible additional sites
a further consultation stage was held on these parcels of land.
G.13 This consultation provided members of the public and other interested parties with a chance
to have their say on the sites included in the document, prior to the council making a decision on
whether any of the sites should be included in the Local Plan Strategy.
G.14 This consultation included a number of potential strategic sites submitted by developer and
land interests that had not previously been subject to consultation during the evolution of the Local
Plan Strategy.
Pre-Submission Core Strategy (November / December 2013)
G.15 The Pre-Submission Core Strategy set out the case for sustainable economic growth and
was the first draft of the strategy that the council wished to adopt to deliver a vibrant sustainable
community and for the management of development in Cheshire East up to 2030.
G.16 The consultation also included a 'Non-Preferred Sites' document which enabled further
comment to be made on all sites considered in the Development Strategy and Potential Additional
Sites Consultation to help make sure the final selection of sites are the most appropriate.
G.17 This consultation allowed interested parties a chance to have their say on the draft document
prior to the council finalising the Local Plan Strategy - Submission Version.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN Strategy 2010-2030

Appendix H: Partners and Initiatives
H.1 The Local Plan Strategy is the spatial expression of the borough's priorities and development
needs going forward. As a key council document, it provides the planning framework to support the
priorities identified in other plans and programmes prepared by the council or in the wider sub-region.
Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership Business Plan (2012 - 2015)
H.2 The Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership
ambition is for Cheshire and Warrington to be the best performing
sub-regional economy outside of the South East. The LEP has
produced a business plan with six strategic priorities, based upon:
Skilled and productive workforce
Business Investment
Infrastructure and connectivity including bringing forward
employment and residential sites
Deregulation
The Rural Economy
Promoting Cheshire and Warrington
H.3 Since the development of this Business Plan, the government has invited LEPs to develop
Strategic Economic Plans (SEP) for their sub-regions. These have a fundamentally different purpose
to the Business Plan as they will form the basis for negotiations between the government and LEPs
on allocations for more public sector funding for local projects and programmes which deliver economic
growth. This funding will be through the Single Local Growth Fund, and the next round of European
Structural and Investment funds.
H.4 The SEP is currently being developed ahead of a draft submission to government (October
2013), and will be informed by key policy frameworks, including the Local Plan Strategy and its key
proposals to promote economic growth.
H.5 The Business Plan contains several transformational projects located in Cheshire East. These
include maintaining Alderley Park as a global centre of research excellence and High Growth City,
which is a longer-term plan for the super-growth of Crewe, delivered on the back of the announced
key rail interchange on the new High Speed 2 railway route. High Growth City will initially focus on
linking Crewe and Macclesfield by way of Congleton creating ‘a corridor of opportunity’.

H.6 The Local Plan Strategy will deliver the place
shaping aspects and objectives of the Sustainable
Community Strategy (SCS). It will also play a key
role in delivering the council's corporate objectives
and other relevant strategies prepared by Cheshire
East Council and its partners.
H.7
‘Ambition for All’ is the Cheshire East
Sustainable Community Strategy (2010) for the
period 2010 to 2025. The purpose of the strategy is
to set out how, over the 15 years, the Partnership
for Action for Cheshire East (PACE) will seek to
ensure that Cheshire East continues to prosper. The activities outlined in the strategy are intended
to improve the quality of life of all the people of Cheshire East and to contribute to the achievement
of sustainable development through action to improve economic, social and environmental well-being
across the area. The Strategy provides a high-level vision for Cheshire East centred around seven
priorities for action, which are:

Nurturing strong communities, including the delivery of services as locally as possible and
ensuring that communities feel safe;
Creating conditions for business growth, including making the most of our tourism, heritage and
natural assets and ensuring there is a range of available high quality employment sites and
premises in all parts of Cheshire East with good transport links, to attract new and expanding
businesses;
Unlocking the potential of our towns; this focuses firstly on the regeneration of Crewe including
the redevelopment of the town centre and the provision of new homes and jobs. Secondly, on
the revitalisation of Macclesfield, including improving the quality and choice of shops and services
in the town centre and progressing the development of South Macclesfield; and thirdly, on
retaining the vitality and viability of our market towns to ensure that they continue to deliver
essential services, retail, leisure and employment opportunities;
Supporting our children and young people;
Ensuring a sustainable future by providing affordable and appropriate housing to meet future
needs, by promoting energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, by ensuring that all
major developments are located with good access to local amenities, cycle and walking routes,
by developing a green infrastructure plan to safeguard, manage and enhance our green assets,
giving priority to the redevelopment of our vacant brownfield sites and by recognising the
importance of mineral extraction to the local economy;
Preparing for an increasingly older population including the provision of an adequate supply of
suitable extra care housing; and
Driving out the causes of poor health including investment in green infrastructure to encourage
active and healthy lifestyle choices.
Local Area Partnerships
H.8
In 2009, Cheshire East Council established 7 Local Area
Partnerships (LAPs), which bring local partner organisations together to
improve services, influence decision making and empower communities,
focusing on what really matters to local people. The LAPs produce annual
Area Plans, which inform their work plans each year. The Area Plans
focus on local issues that cannot be tackled by one organisation on its
own, bringing together all those with an ability to make a difference.
Priorities are identified by community led planning, partner agencies and
local data.
H.9 Cheshire East Council and partners are currently developing a new approach to locality working,
reviewing how the council and partners devolve and integrate a wide range of service delivery and
activities and how the more resilient and self sufficient local communities are developed, which reduce
unnecessary demands on public services. The new approach needs to balance citizens' rights and
their responsibilities, along with ensuring that local needs, preferences and aspirations are met.

H.12 The Local Transport Plan (LTP) aims to capitalise on the
strengths of the existing transport system in Cheshire East, including
good transport links to major centres via the rail and motorway
network.
H.13 The Plan identifies that good transport connections are integral
to plans for economic growth and to protect our environment to ensure
a sustainable future for all our residents and businesses. Following
consultation, the priorities for the LTP are to ensure a sustainable
future and to create the conditions for business growth. Future
investment in transport will be directed towards the policies and
interventions which support these priority areas to help grow the
economy and tackle carbon emissions.
All Change for Crewe 2010 - 2030
H.14 All Change for Crewe is an ambitious strategy to support
Crewe’s economic development over the 20 year period. The
strategy intends that by 2030 Crewe will be:
a nationally significant economic centre with a total population
in excess of 100,000 people (currently it has about 83,000);
one of the leading centres for advanced engineering and
manufacturing centres in England; and
recognised as a sought-after place for people to live, work, put down roots and develop their
talents.
H.15 In 2011, a business-led Partnership Board was established, with the support of the Council,
to assist in shaping and driving the All Change for Crewe programme. It articulated its ambitions in
the 2012 Prospectus for Crewe, which also identified key town centre development opportunities,
resulting in significant interest from developers, investors and other partners.

H.16 The government's current plans for a High Speed Railway (HS2) include
a route through Crewe Station, with a partial connection to the West Coast
Mainline, have given added impetus for economic growth in Crewe, the rest
of the sub-region and beyond. High Growth City is the programme that will
deliver the ambitions of All Change for Crewe up to 2030. However, with the
prospect still remaining of a HS2 Hub station at Crewe with a direct interchange,
the prospects for super-charged growth beyond 2030 arise that will take the
town forward from this point with even higher levels of growth. This could be
focused around a new Central Business District at the HS2 Hub Station at
Crewe.

are articulated in its Investment Prospectus and Business Plan.
Housing Strategy - Moving Forward 2011 - 2016
H.20 The Cheshire East Housing Strategy 'Moving Forward' 2011 - 2016 sets out the council's long
term housing vision for the borough. The strategy has been developed at a time of significant change
within the housing sector, with a move towards localism and the flexibility to make local decisions.
These changes are identified as great opportunities for the authority to address housing at a local
level, in order to create balanced and sustainable communities across Cheshire East.
H.21 The Strategy establishes five key objectives. These are: delivering market and affordable
housing; making the best use of our existing stock; meeting the needs of our most vulnerable residents;
meeting the needs of an ageing population; and investing in our neighbourhoods.
Vision and Strategy for Economic Growth: East Cheshire - Engine of the North
H.22 This high level vision, investment plan and economic strategy identified the role of the council
in delivering economic growth through initiatives including the Local Plan Strategy as part of the Local
Plan; place based initiatives; commissioning; investment; and the council's own assets, to enable the
conditions for growth.
H.23

The three key elements of the strategy for growth are:
Productive and competitive businesses - a focus on key assets, established and emerging
sectors and image and identity
New investment and business development - a focus on capacity, the package and the proposition
Creating the conditions for sustainable growth - a focus on sustainable development, connectivity,
housing and neighbourhoods, town centres and the rural and visitor offer.

Economic Development Strategy
H.24 The Cheshire East Economic Development Strategy sets out the council's understanding of
the local economy and the key challenges ahead. It presents the council's economic development
objectives at the strategic level and how these translate into our thematic and spatial priorities for the
Borough. The principal focus is on three spatial priorities relating to Crewe, Macclesfield and our
market towns and rural hinterlands.

Cheshire East has the fastest growing ageing population in the North West;
and that by 2033 more than 45% of our population will be over 50 years of
age. It aims to make Cheshire East a better place to grow old. If the programme is successful then
Cheshire East will see a fundamental cultural and organisational shift, so that over time:
Older people will have more choice and control, can receive the help they need and are valued
and respected within their communities.
Public, private and voluntary sectors will work with communities to ensure that services, facilities
and resources are accessible and able to meet demand.
Services and support will be locally based, cost-effective and sustainable.
